michael cohen’s testimony doom trumpwith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardtand bernie sanders democratic frontrunneri’m david leonhardt “the argument” week president trump’s former lawyer testified congress mean we’re new stage trump presidencyyou know feel like we’re left question of anything matterthen bernie sanders democratic frontrunnerhe may frontrunner certainly frontrunnerafter two years robert mueller’s investigation russian interference election finally seems winding down within weeks investigation could completed mueller could submit report justice department that’s investigation trump faces new democratic majority congress ready exercise power oversight yesterday trump’s former lawyer michael cohen testified front house oversight committee campaign trump’s business practices mattersi oath correct record answer committee’s questions truthfully offer american people know president trumpwe’re recording late wednesday afternoon ross able join us michelle going sort through michelle make everything happened michael cohenso feeling right — we’re kind morning session resumption later evening — sort of know numb despair fact likely won’t enough end unendurable nightmare presidency even though obviously be sort imagine testimony like closest confidant one closest confidants president know hard evidence committing felonies also testament his know despicable character testament fact was colluding foreign power clearly seeking financial gain foreign power entire time running president saying wonderful things vladimir putin try think back about like could foreseen moment trump elected know could said within twoplus years michael cohen know consigliere going sitting front congress calling racist con man cheat could projected predicted that know back nightmare began would kind assumed end game right get point means it’s wrapping up yet feel like we’re left question of know anything matteryeah mean guess me optimistic take today knew wasn’t going smoking gun going make republican house members say “ah wrong follow along” way least surprising thing today guess case optimism people like following closely months end lot americans haven’t hearing that’s going dominate tv social media think way whole bunch people haven’t paying attention going start pay attention it way feel like good trump none republicans defending merits here right they’re coming crazy conspiracies —and there’s something fascinating cohen actually knocking —a lot stories rumors trump right he’s kind saying — mythical elevator tape trump hitting melania believes doesn’t exist he’s saying even though paid someone information love child doesn’t believe love child real kind said knowledge doesn’t know trump paying women “medical procedures” is know code abortion says he’s never prague he’s actually saying lot things —right exculpatory know obviously headline kind snippet assume people see kind extraordinary opening statement madeyeah conservative writer byron york nice summary twitter here’s wrote “michael cohen knocking various crazy antitrump stories prague” — reference meeting apparently didn’t happen involving trump campaign prague — “money laundering lovechild abortion elevator tape tapes more this republicans spent time attacking credibility” actually person who’s sort defending trump substance today michael cohen crazywell say one thing really surprised michael cohen coming across really well know think impression always dimwitted thug know it’s think he’s honorable man seem little bit quicker feet republican congressmen that’s necessarily saying much mean one republican congressmen said “you called president cheat would call yourself” michael cohen said “a fool” like weighty silence tried think say response right mean almost sense he’s really trying speak congressmen believe trump sort caught defending trump way caught defending trump right really seemed trying almost like break themi agree came well think made two mistakes times let temper get better yelled republican questioners and understand he’d that don’t think helps him second — don’t know thought — explanation reason flipped trump decided trump become evil trump said charlottesville trump putin helsinki don’t think that’s credible think it’s pretty clear flipped facing prison time right assume agree thatyes no course obviously turned trump think know selfpreservation also probably sense betrayal trump didn’t come rescue turned him threw bus know kind pretended never known relationship hadn’t intimate michael cohen imagined be know thing would say hard believe line kind never wanted job white houseoh that’s interesting mean could see someone wouldn’t find crediblei don’t know reporting i’ve seen suggested thought going white house chief staff know imagined going washington mean feel like trust reporting i’ve seen michael cohen’s word structure thing frustrating right like five minute five minute back forth mean many threads want people pick on also wanted someone say response republicans keep saying know “how trust you done terrible corrupt things” say well say president personal lawyer keep wanting somebody put end kind selfrighteous posturing like could people’s business instead we’re listening criminal know people literally called diamond silk hearing whether conservative voices get adequate play social mediamy big takeaway we’re going look forward democrats need lot this is really need use house majority try sort what’s true what’s trump look crazy theories we’ve heard going end true right cohen shot down lot going end true guess look makes say democrats need lot this need lot calling witnesses need get trump’s tax returns — don’t completely understand they’re waiting long that mean isn’t hope basically beginning period we’re going see lot hearings like thisyeah mean think are know adam schiff told much intends house intelligence committee mean clearly think jerry nadler intends judiciary committee so speaking optimism know there’s really interesting book called “the battle public opinion” sort wonky book polling watergate looking carefully public opinion turned watergate people know didn’t think important nixon defenders called witch hunt republicans congress poohpoohed it really started turn televised hearings i’m sure that’s replicable current environment everyone’s attention much fragmented particular hearing right mean it’s cable news it’s networks it’s going news broadcasts mean congressmen think they’re really dumb sort theatrically obtusei think they’re theatrically obtuse what’s old line it’s hard get man believe something paycheck depends believing it lot people start defying trump political careers doneright i’m thinking like one congressman says he’d never heard michael he’s implying michael cohen like thrilled television that’s about said something like i’ve never heard todaywhich like really well deputy finance chair republican national committee one hand thought like actually truebut probably people know maybe lot people michael cohen like know best kind name they’ve seen news don’t really clear picture of it’s become impossible try like project mind outward think like somebody doesn’t think trump unfit processing this even though think empathetic person hard get mind around would like look trump think business president united statesso since ross can’t us let try channel end here mean we’ve listened say look end people elected trump knowing kind sleazy businessman that’s different evidence actually participated sort conspiracy putin’s government feel like lead mueller report released lot people saying know mueller report might disappointing trump’s critics see cohen’s testimony damaging was plays that right know never said trump directed lie looks like buzzfeed story wrongwell doesn’t right mean feel like kind suggests buzzfeed story wrong implicitly urged lieyeah that’s fair mean guess don’t think that’s going win people haven’t yet guess i’m sort interested in given case you’re feeling mueller report sort preparing possibility it’s going feel like dud still think it’s going big dealwell mean think both right people like hoping mueller report necessarily it’s going expose giant conspiracy giant conspiracy plain sight it’s summon enough evidence people kind mulishly denying longer able to that’s pretty high bar whether end debate stuff think different whether show trump traitor impeached mean that’s already amply demonstratedyeah mean i’m sure would go far traitor certainly would go far violated oath violated law doesn’t deserve presidenti mean would say traitor probably technical — like right probably law we’re technically — know we’re war russia understand yes doesn’t meet legal definition treason could put red baseball cap know “doesn’t meet legal definition treason” feel like that’s best could say presidentand cringeworthy moment republican member congress tried defend trumpand way dragging lynn patton — who’s africanamerican woman previously trumpfamily wedding planner qualified her trump’s estimation part department housing urban development — basically literally dragged out don’t think even said anythingright standing like black woman says trump isn’t racistyeah thought one finest moments house member hearing brenda lawrence — who’s congresswoman michigan — later said “how dare use old trope single africanamerican person proves whether someone racist not” thought really important didn’t let moment go really quite bluntly called republicans that mean evidence donald trump racist michael cohen it’s like years public statementsi mean one weirdest taboos american politics idea it’s kind way controversial right mean kamala harris recently said like yes trump racist — controversial statement saying like yes trump’s skin color unnatural it’s just it’s evident naked eyeit sort feel like we’ve entered new phase here doesn’t it right we’re expecting mueller report it’s beginning big hearings feels like finally it’s going scoops good journalism it’s going really public accounting trump done led house democrats don’t know it’s going end i’m happy phasedo think hearing gets us closer impeachment proceedingsin strict definition i’d say yes little bit closer mean don’t think house jump impeachment said raises whole bunch questions house needs pursue need go tax returns need pursue notion jay sekulow white house lawyer may played role preparing cohen’s false testimony that’s going land cohen jail real upside democrats opening something call capital “i” impeachment think instead go really hard substance stuff substance russia substance white house cover up substance campaign finance violations it go really hard it months longer feels like said we’re sort tantalizingly beginning evidence actually clearer sense really happened — point i’m totally open idea open impeachment hearings fact maybe good option point guess think look political open impeachment think keep going substance it although agree substance don’t think it’s crazy talking impeachment it’s probably right look obviously we’re going learn lot next weeks we’re expecting mueller report then come back talk show course comes out now though we’re going take quick break we’ll back segment ross talk bernie sanders bernie sanders backso senator sanders you’re going run presidentand time isn’t longshot outsider among presidential candidates leads everyone joe biden polls it’s still clear whether biden even running day sanders announced campaign raised  million far candidates announcement day today we’re going talk whether sanders deserves treated frontrunner whether presence campaign likely help hurt democrats retake white house want start emotional aspect sanders campaign really inspire strong feelings democratic voters many view good candidate many others seem resent him michelle help us understand bernie gets people worked upit’s couple different things mean there’s still lot really hard feelings left  lot people feel like hung long way could get nomination kind left progressives party demobilized demoralized obviously russians able exploit that people believe finally endorse hillary start campaigning sort grudging halfhearted know whole concept “bernie bro” really controversial volatile understand lot supporters resent feel like it’s smear whole movementcan michelle define listeners “bernie bro“a certain kind socialist white male enjoys hectoring nonbernie supporters concerns identity politics kind trivial bourgeois there’s like certain kind of experience sneering white male bernie supporter grating think unfairly maybe colored perceptions bernie let put way husband acquaintances probably never speak interactions campaignright one big questions hanging bernie i’ve always thought unlike lot people may frontrunner nomination certainly frontrunner know you’re looking divided field right lots lots lots candidates getting in obviously bernie isn’t going command voters voted protest vote hillary clinton least there’s clearly percent democratic electorate plausibly ready bernie that’s big chunk divided field that’s chunk build want win new hampshire iowa plausible states plausible states bernie sanders win i’ve always sort taken seriously candidate big question one raised michelle’s bad memories right extraordinary level ill feelings left campaign democratic side think creates strong antibernie bias among bunch kind liberals progressives would think would different context open supporting him sort big hurdle potentially get overi’m saying he’s going win isn’t bigger issue “lefttwitter” people say real world aren’t lot feelings intense among journalists operatives among large numbers voters bernie actually emerges one two people race don’t know guess instinct he’s actually going lose many votes bad feelingsi think look polls know look polls asking harris supporters example opinions candidates don’t — know people support kamala harris don’t negative opinions large bernie sanders that’s sort true lot candidates right democratic electorate much less polarized twitter worst case scenario comes bernie sanders kamala harris like reprise knockdowndragout battle classfirst approach progressive politics one takes account issues representation identity politics lack better word so know think could potentially get really ugly know bernie sanders comes process nominee think people coalesce behind pretty quickly there’s something interesting going anyone else think would obvious everyone frontrunner right he’s leading polls he’s leading donations runnerup last time around something like trump took everybody think long time internalize fact trump frontrunner even though leading polls even though sorts metrics frontrunner couldn’t get head around it think there’s something similar going herei think there’s fascinating analogy keep pushing twitter people aren’t really excited maybe it’s fascinating bernie sanders ronald reagan  sanders looks lot like reagan going election runnerup bitterly contested primary battle like primary battle reagan fought ford avatar sort ideological movement within political party widely seen old extreme get party’s nomination let alone win presidency against potentially president donald trump who personal differences resemblance jimmy carter sense sort weak president trying hold together failing coalition totally tell story happened reagan happens bernie sanders he’s next president united states like tell story conservative audiences freak little bitwhen make argument almost sort makes inclined support bernie sanders feeling — still fear he’s old even though he’s incredibly popular hillary clinton also incredibly popular election so know maybe it’s age sort personal temperamental caution worry videos praising old soviet union praising know sandinistas nicaragua think younger socialists can’t quite imagine salience modern world kind feel like people will think goes part makes many people don’t support kind support politics angry it’s whole theory case it’s doesn’t sort take identity politics seriously it’s can’t quite believe anybody else takes identity politics seriously there’s debate among people don’t like trump ever since calamity election whether voters driven kind “economic anxiety” whether driven racial resentment know proportion two things played role sanders think believes driven economic anxiety and know week ago one pollsters telling politico think win states like montana west virginia indiana have know basically analysis white workingclass voters give populist option kind cultural grievances become secondary become less important don’t see evidence decades american politics make think that’s truelook i’m “bernie bro” bernie bros first tell you think way bernie’s sweet spot american politics economically left yes he’s left americans economically left sort talking much stuff disagreewell that’s fair question all laugh best thing bernie is one he’s sweet spot two think he’s pushing right direction three doesn’t talk like journalist economist talks like really savvy politician keeps repeating message again problems scratch surface policies think lot less thoughtful than say elizabeth warren’s policies think go details policies also trying move country left gives thought things like unintended consequences actual details implementation think bernie’s basic analysis would succeed president of “look we’re going build movement republicans gonna come along” think way simplistic problems himi think also haven’t tested hypothesis bernielevel leftism general election winner clear think bernie beat trump think might tougher time selfconsciously moderate democratic candidate i’m sure he’d tougher time people running sort liberaltoleft lane lot people right now it’s bernie’s positions left it’s true party whole moved roughly is it’s also whole personal history tribune socialism debate go back forth socialism means bernie sanders ‘ clearly meant soviet union kind cool place righti don’t think literally good representative democratic party is right mean democratic party point coalition people color affluent educated white liberals right kind somebody like bernie know obviously draws groups absolutely whose vision progressive movement is think still imagines lot people white working class i’m sure that’s coalition focused mobilizing want win think it’s possible run much savvier campaign time around know campaign manager faiz shakir know there’s something lovely fact viable jewish politician ever wage — know ever run president has far know first muslim run major presidential campaign that’s sort future want know it’s possible run campaign that know kind sidesteps see blinkered view kind democratic party isso let’s end here mean view — ross said clearly think bernie sanders frontrunner would — right terms likelihood getting nomination put sanders kamala harris joe biden may may run top tier think next tier includes beto elizabeth warren maybe others objections way i’ve i’ve laid thereyeah mean think would put cory booker next tier wellyeah think that’s right mean think biden weird he’s sort like right dark matter race — know something sanders right know sort committed bernie movement may percent democratic electorate it’s real biden it’s sort general good feelings guy haven’t tested heat campaign certain ways could say he’s sort different category harris sandersso there’s poll got lot attention democrats asked whether want candidate going win candidate agree clear result democrats want candidate who’s going win ross offering democrats advice know one favorite pastimes top tier candidates think gives best chance wini mean think we’re including biden top three think biden likely win largest possible majority doesn’t mean think that’s still safest plausible bet think bernie harris question basically — way bernie wins bigger harris gives lot conservatives sense really cares class culture war course exactly thing michelle finds potentially objectionable him one things trumpera republican party able sort maintain sort level culture war mobilization culture war anxiety among religious conservatives especially speaking religious conservative like fact bernie wants talk class wants talk culture war basically harris might end reverse that’s path bigger bernie victorywell want invite let us know candidates we’re talking enough about give us call   tell us democratic candidates want hear about may play show it’s time weekly recommendation every week give tip way get mind politics ross turn week uswell we’ve talking bernie sanders possible affection soviet union back day coincidence oscars
