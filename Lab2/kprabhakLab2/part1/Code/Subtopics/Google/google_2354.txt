that’s future right now autonomous drone completing racecourse speed faster  miles per hour accomplishmentthis year new competition try make sure autonomous drones nimble — truly able act themselves“right now autonomous drones thing you’d find labs pioneered small niche audience” said keith lynn lockheed martin’s program manager alphapilot autonomous drone racing competition organized drone racing leaguethe alphapilot competition sponsored lockheed martin part racing league’s new artificial intelligence robotic racing circuit aims drive interest research selfdriving autonomous vehicles nine teams compete fall currently making way qualifying rounds — students ai researchers independent drone enthusiasts among others — according organizers winning team take home prize  million ai drone also beat top human pilot headtohead race team get extra   competitors league said program racer includes artificial intelligence chip made nvidia partner competition nine qualifying teams announced spring according organizersfor autonomous drones useful — disaster zones delivery vehicles rural areas — need able fly far fast without human oversight often environments can’t rely external guidance systems like gps that’s one biggest challenges“current autonomous drones little onboard decisionmaking” said kerry snyder founder kef robotics competing team pittsburgh “they almost always following specific human commands rarely able accomplish higher level tasks ‘find trapped person’ ‘fly open window explore’”there’s also gap code created lab realworld flying “a lot ai primarily developed simulation” said dr chelsea sabo technical lead alphapilot program lockheed martin “going simulation real world going big challenge alphapilot”machine learning allows ai train much faster fleshandblood pilots human wants practice  hours needs threeandahalf years eighthour days computer using machine learning fly  simulated hours overnight eric amoroso another cofounder kef robotics said autonomous vehicles also precise human pilots autonomous drones fly precisely making subtle alterations much thrust propeller produces example said use information sensors humans don’t have like accelerometer estimate spacebut humans excel — ai general falls short — merging individual skills cohesive whole fast humans capable “sensing world making decisions acting it realtime that’s really fundamental challenge robotics” mr amoroso said autonomous drones also struggle make sense visual information particularly high speeds part shortcomings sensors “the main challenge autonomous drone flight perception based cameras” said davide scaramuzza professor robotics perception university zurich creator autonomous drone competition madrid last year “the faster drone goes blurred image gets”a drone flying alphapilot competition able fly based see front it must use information know physical space miles per hour even calculating speed computers capable of autonomous drone won’t able process images fast human can may thrown course something simple shadow leading miss gate believe it’s one foot right actually is best means autonomous drone need course correct slowing down worst crashesthere’s also issue strategy “a pilot thousands hours flight time isn’t thinking gate front them” mr nurkkala racing league champion said “they’re thinking next five six gates position keep best racing line” inside simulator alphapilot drone might able make sorts tactical strategic plans realworld course moving speed may best hit gateand going fast calculation risk versus reward you’re flying without ever crashing mr nurkkala said you’re flying fast possible teams programming alphapilot drones mean training drones make tradeoffs speed play safe — decisions humans often make instinctually “in simulations tune system finishes course percent time flies pretty slow” mr snyder said “or tune finish course percent time flies much faster” winner alphapilot competition —  million grand prize — likely team optimizes algorithms also take smartest risksand autonomous drone outrace humancontrolled one “in opinion would similar deep blue alphago” mr snyder said referring chessplaying computer deepmind ai “it represents major step technical progress innovation even limited environment autonomous robot could realistically outperform human that’s contrast infinite fractal complexity selfdriving cars”mr lynn effusive “everyone know programmers behind team they’ll celebrities companies want endorse them kids aspire them that’s exciting stem perspective”and mr lynn believes professional pilots also take notice “i think you’ll also see humanpiloted drl races change pilots learn efficiencies computer code hone on approach maneuvers entirely new ways that’s exciting future human machine teamwork”
