trump causing white terrorismwith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardtand would fair college admissions system look likei’m david leonhardt “the argument” week president trump causing white supremacist terrorism red herringthen fair college admission system look likethere still efforts schools admit exclusively stupidest heirs shipping familiesin interview last week president trump suggested supporters might resort violence didn’t get way two days later gunman killed least people two mosques new zealand suspected killer’s manifesto cited trump’s friendliness white nationalism today want talk whether it’s fair draw connection trump white nationalist violence part problem symptom underlying illness talk colleague jamelle bouie calling charlottesville virginia welcome back show jamellejamelle think state white supremacy movement right now think it’s growing think it’s always sort small meaningful way it’s getting attention right nowso think it’s less kind ever present part american society it’s hard look given period american history kind organized movement white supremacists specifically like virulent violent white supremacists times even explicit state sanction think remember depending times american history movements kind different relationship societies second ku klux klan late exists less bolster mainstream ideas americanism predominance kind white anglosaxon america current iteration taking kind autonomous cell model ‘ ‘ shows — timothy mcveigh oklahoma city bomber part “leaderless resistance” term use — kind super charging thati mean me jamelle know conservative politics overlaps people’s populist politics turn overlaps people sort scarily close fringe views seems there’s big shift mostly internet sort outside eventsdriven last five six years think one way look really well illustrated horrifying new zealand case kind globalization european anxiety you’ve large trend towards immigration cultural conflict around islam europe going years decades sort brought sharp point syrian refugee crisis rise isis wave isisinspired bombings turn created kind white identitarian theory world found acolytes north america way australia new zealand sort took pieces european experience normative state global whiteness became inspiration cases violence time think it’s connected might call kind crisis white christian church western world lot children grow seem like failing culturally irrelevant forms christianity often end sort contempt christianity don’t turn left that turn sort racial identityand nihilistic troll culture seems like one ways there’s politician far know anywhere earth effectively bridges chan shitposting european replacement theory right that’s donald trump it’s necessarily think donald trump inspired movement think success right fact you’re going give life service act horrific mass violence it’s usually think horrific act mass violence going get closer grandiose goal one things donald trump done made feel like dreams slightly less impossible right basically white supremacist shitposter become president united states maybe dreamedfor revolution really happeni want home trump’s role here mean it’s really clear trump plays causal role this look rise racism antisemitism social media that’s way read data pretty significant increase different data sets they’re imperfect guess want see whether you probably likely ross disagrees idea — he’s cause fact white nationalist president united states making stuff commonyeah guess think see terms use decent historical analogy see terms relationship andrew johnson kind antiblack vigilante violence immediate postcivil war period it’s andrew johnson caused didn’t give shit right laughs didn’t care much it times happened excused felt heard people ground indifference occasional sort like complicity creates atmosphere people willing inflict violence decide maybe get away it maybe it’s done send message message get kind amplification powerful political leader think that’s kind important dynamic i’m sure would attribute causal mechanism feedback loop happeningthe piece feel like trump’s election convinced people convinced white nationalists much wider support they’d realized right mean think terrorists act sense they’re acting behalf greater silent population poll recently shows something like percent people believe trump opposes white nationalism tells large number supporters believe trump not fact oppose white nationalism feel like you’re willing take kind steps believe people behind you believe you’re going kind support even sort catalytic effect you’re going spark sort uprisingi think i’m closer jamelle’s take michelle’s think right way understand trump yeah he’s someone doesn’t give shit white nationalism president united states powerful office lot cultural influence undoubtedly toxic effects culture kind role spreading ideas making seem credible on think calling trump white nationalist sort analytic mistake mean we’ve discussion before counts white nationalism think imputes level ideology doesn’t have think it’s reasonable call sort bigot racist white nationalist guess i’d put way think things would happening without donald trump think conversation episode causes much important next years world history trump isn’t doing think it’s good right condemn trump handles stuff enables people don’t think ultimately either extreme people acting general drift driven much idea donald trump elected build white ethnostate think dreams white ethnostate responses much broader dislocations anxieties transformations trump kind particularly striking epiphenomenoni’m saying trump causing really don’t think would trump hadn’t run campaign mean trump plus year history racism right going back ads newspapers central park case runs office runs raceconscious racist campaign we’ve basically seen adult lifetime along surge racism antisemitism online graffiti best tell numbers actual crimes i’m saying he’s main cause don’t think it’s enough say doesn’t care white nationalism would happening hadn’t showed it’s possible go say things still elected presidenti mean guess think it’s tough disentangle two like you’re think one lines history western society present slow motion collapse race hierarchy least slow motion collapse race hierarchy explicit forms lots things happening reaction that look trump like ross said epiphenomena that entire career right like someone who’s casual bigotry casual racism acted racism kind makes curiosity first national life time goes becomes part public persona also it’s hard say trump wasn’t much would happening year actually week trump announced campaign dylann roof killed nine people charleston right sort like kind violence precedes trump planning trump feel like i’m willing say causal relationship like trump’s campaign style disregard willingness elevate people kind adjacent world — borrow terminology last decade politics — aid comfort enemy right but i’m sure it’s causallet’s end here i’d interested thoughts quickly think plays american public point trump obviously thinks still plays well mean ran closing week midterm campaign basically running would describe kind white nationalist message much think actually helps heading hurts point jamelleit’s always easier start like baseline view things baseline view things trump could somehow stop talking november win reelection right like background conditions american society good enough people could forget donald trump president would win donald trump’s problem cannot stop talking cannot stop reminding people president kind aggressive offensive disheartening ways extent language rhetoric that remind people things specifically dislike president donald trump hurts cannot help himyou know donald trump minority president right elected minority coalition reelection depends sort minority rule united states perpetuation minority rule united states inasmuch that’s bet he’s made way keeps base united think keep giving want president completely embrace racial cultural grievances desire spite enemies became decent man can’t become might expand coalition little bit would lessen intensityi think michelle right portion trump’s base sort responds comments also sort media attacks comments ending binding tightly him general i’m jamelle think time sort flirtation white nationalism stuff really helped trump early republican primaries trying build initial base support that’s started birtherism helped become candidate supporters point know economy good different version trumpism authentically populist economics constantly flirting white nationalism think would much electorally effective don’t think stuff hurts much people read new york times think hurt him don’t think helps meaningful wayok we’re going leave take quick break right back talk big college admissions scandal it’s story bourgeois america can’t stop talking aboutflurry new indictments today ensnaring celebrities ceos college coaches massive scheme game college admissions systemlast week federal prosecutors charged people scheme buy spots elite colleges details amazing bald lies athletic prowess doctored photo football player straight cheating standardized tests story led many people ask purpose elite colleges actually be ross thoughtprovoking argument topic week i’ve noodling argument ever since don’t spin us talk itwell return usual theme meritocracy failure trying contrarian relative people said well look shows meritocracy corrupted people buy way schools they’re rich fake sat scores on actually mean think faking sat scores actually testament meritocracy sense turns rich kids can’t get schools unless literally fake high enough sat scoresthe hours tutoring enough right sense you’re concerned is system selecting smart kids kind scandal shake confidence it question whether actually makes sense system you’re telling everyone we’re selecting smart kids good elite schools maybe affirmative action programs legacy admission programs better world elite schools sort purely meritocratic admitted kids satsbut possible defense legacy admissionsthe reason schools want families sort intergenerational loyalties sort invested school school’s success radical argument every society elite it’s bad thing elites sense stewardship continuity legacy admissions worst way bring about want elite continuity generation generation obviously well outside norm arguments democratic society seems might true i’m curious jamelle thinks strange rightwing defense affirmative actionso like area potential convergence agree real meritocracy american society extent meritocracy kind like transmission acts transmit inherited advantages accept that kind buy premise meritocracy isn’t necessarily great way distributing resources like access elite colleges — elite colleges i’m going define like you’re harvard yale kind like highly selective schools overall remember scandal kids trying get uscand think it’s important add public schools it right mean jamelle you’re talking us charlottesville university virginia university north carolina michigan berkeley they’re part wellright you’ve mean uva — i’m uva grad uva conception basically cultivate political social elite state virginia that’s designed do that’s institutions actually doing addition they’re research institutions provide education also cultivating elites i’m ross i’d rather something explicit discussion rather submerged bunch pretense two things really influence thinking here first sociologist orlando patterson years ago book “the ordeal integration” makes case affirmative action case affirmative action isn’t merit it’s simply sufficiently elite organization what’s going happen people going selecting people similar them want institutions diverse better reflect country mandate take people look differently second thing big college education scandal happened year tm landry college prep school scandal small private school louisiana high poverty town school’s graduates overwhelmingly black poor both school sending class class ivy league schools turns either falsifying grades activities creating kind fake sob stories appeal heartstrings white elites want solid poor black kid louisiana interesting thing kids many fine schools maybe hard time first year got better they’re fine says something schools idea score top echelon anything succeed trueright it’s kind school makes succeedright exactly that’s true then know let’s drop pretense meritocracy then let’s say ross suggested we’re kind cultivating elite want elite look like united states terms racial diversity regional diversity religious diversity forth go there make decisions based that versus again pretense times think pretense actually quite important american politics past years one them think drop somewhatthe thing don’t completely understand though what’s logical extension argument you’re making say hey elite schools regional diversity do i’m you university texas great system that’s mostly worked extremely well took originally top percent high school class say racially diverse economically diverse i’m whole way pick gets university texas university virginia harvard you’ve done that don’t think you’re actually — either jamelle ross — suggesting sort lottery slots think want meritocracy part processright went like balancing meritocracy representationbut always balance right like even — reference popular column ever — even old days wasp hegemony right still efforts schools admit exclusively stupidest heirs shipping families rightsome efforts efforts didn’t go far laughsbut think people overestimate hostile past talent right course want elite talented say you’re elite school we’re gonna set minimum sat score pegged average distribution sat scores ethnic group region whatever we’re going ensure we’re admitting people can’t handle work all obviously don’t get rid sort bias towards merit assume system right might biased towards merit elite level think there’s larger conversation harvard yale pretended they’re mass opportunity game they’re not they’re tiny elite schools meanwhile rest american higher ed pretended they’re like harvard yale fact need state schools different approach catholic schools different approach historically black colleges different approach need much investment community college vocational education definitely shift elite colleges approach things would go handinhand shift like know midlevel state universities handle things might case like certain kinds public universities meritocratic be know based tests know lot different approachesi mean one reason sort meritocratic ideals important create illusion fairness around what’s extremely unfair system underlying kind structural thing massively unequal society insane kind funnel system decide deserves opportunity sort of know dignity health decent life right start kind saying we’re going allocate healthy existence getting schools — many cases means kind excelling standardized tests — completely deform educational incentives starting pretty far back make stakes process kind intolerably high everyoneone thing want add discussion think virginia attended public school part solution terms taking pressure taking weight scramble get sort like ultraelite schools is addition equal society also society opportunities broadly distributed really succeed major way kind uproot community move major city maybe even completely different state kind make important then attain kind credential recognized nationally harvard degree yale degree is get education virginia tech find opportunity virginia north carolina things regional terms distribution like elites kind diffuses tensioni mean american system long time national elite narrow elite regional elites could get into mean think still especially case south jamelle correct i’m wrong sense sort regional schools pull south elsewhere coasts sort ivy hierarchy people think aboutthis good cynical person first segment think i’m least cynical person segment mean illusion meritocracy it’s highly flawed meritocracy i’m really glad scandal pushing colleges think ways they’re meritocratic one way think supremely cynical sports whole reason people able get kids ludicrously large bonuses athletes get applying huge share students schools athletes mentioned week email newsletter percent students williams college elite college massachusetts recruited athletes turns way conservative it’s closer percent thirty percent entering students williams college year recruited athletes williams massive outlier agree system sports played smaller role i’m saying role smaller role higher education would healthyi would say this think world sports played less role big state schools would better think there’s lot evidence effects big time sports big time college programs campus culture really toxic think jocks elite schools fineso ross think current level ok think percent students schools recruited athletes many sports one goes watch many sports overwhelmingly white affluent that’s oki mean look you’re asking would cut order big quotas conservative catholics course course would goldberg leonhardt laughso know everyone knows sports hater instead sort lowering stakes offering routes kind elite schools seems sports culture ends kind raising expecting kids excel along different axes expecting prove like really fraudulent kind wellroundedness feel like talk people — wasn’t part culture all mean don’t think even really knew ivy league schools applying school nobody really shepherding process i’m sort outsider it i’m parent thing dread child children sort trying put different paces make spend know one adolescence engaging kind pointless extracurricular activities test prepping things get ready hunger games competition seems like we’ve created culture like entire families supposed orient lives getting process sort corrupted pointless know it’s create elite it’s profound waste time energy and know limited number days earthi think we’re parents whose kids thankfully young fully immersed madness truth know joke idea replacing system lottery frankly wouldn’t kind fantastic totally random lottery nothing could parentand utopian note leave discussion jamelle thank much joining usnow it’s time weekly
