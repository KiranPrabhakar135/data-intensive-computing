warnings dark side ai health carelast year food drug administration approved device capture image retina automatically detect signs diabetic blindnessthis new breed artificial intelligence technology rapidly spreading across medical field scientists develop systems identify signs illness disease wide variety images xrays lungs cat scans brain systems promise help doctors evaluate patients efficiently less expensively pastsimilar forms artificial intelligence likely move beyond hospitals computer systems used health care regulators billing companies insurance providers ai help doctors

researchers harvard mit warnsin paper published thursday journal science researchers raise prospect “adversarial attacks” — manipulations change behavior ai systems using tiny pieces digital data

must consider scenarios build evaluate ai technologies years come authors argue concern less hackers might cause patients misdiagnosed although potential exists likely doctors hospitals organizations could manipulate ai billing insurance software effort maximize money coming waysamuel finlayson researcher harvard medical school mit one authors paper warned much money changes hands across health care industry stakeholders already bilking system subtly changing billing codes data computer systems track health care visits ai could exacerbate problem“the inherent ambiguity medical information coupled oftencompeting financial incentives allows highstakes decisions swing subtle bits information” saidthe new paper adds growing sense concern possibility attacks could aimed everything face

adversarial attacks could fool selfdriving cars seeing things there making small changes street signs duped cars detecting yield sign instead stop signlate last year team nyu’s tandon school

ai diagnosis “alcohol abuse” could produce different diagnosis “alcohol dependence” “lumbago” could produce different diagnosis “back painin turn changing diagnoses one way another could readily benefit insurers health care agencies ultimately profit them ai deeply rooted health care system researchers argue business gradually adopt behavior brings moneythe end result could harm patients mr finlayson said changes doctors make medical scans patient data effort satisfy ai used insurance companies could end patient’s permanent record affect decisions roadalready doctors hospitals organizations sometimes manipulate software systems control billions dollars moving across industry doctors instance subtly changed billing codes — instance describing simple xray complicated scan —
