awfulsenator elizabeth warren setting terms conversation policy presidential campaign she’s come series ideas big bold would say radical annual tax holdings wealthy universal child care breakup big tech companies requirement corporate boards include workers whether warren wins nomination she’s influencing future democratic party wanted sit give proper hearing ideas invited producer alex laughlin apartment washington dc recorded conversation — fittingly enough — kitchen table senator warren welcome “the argument”so know lot people also running president friendsthis life’s work look think economics what’s happened working families what’s happening middle class families path gotten much steeper much rockier hardworking people even steeper even rockier people color moment tackle one head on run straight middle say we’re going make change hereso you’ve alive previous presidential campaigns know republicans paint democratic nominee particular you’re nominee right going make democratic nominee lab right probably wouldn’t former harvard professor fight back say massachusetts liberali’m going push back whole notion work look born raised oklahoma i’m baby three older brothersyes significantly older brothersthey three joined military chance make middle class daddy ended janitor big chance life commuter college cost  semester ultimately got public school teacher worked specialneeds kidsand let go part pregnanti know got pushed door turned around law school public law school cost  semester way see lived opportunity don’t abstract think opportunity great i’ve lived it i’ve lived kind opportunity comes government invests little kids government tries keep playing field little bit level folks like family believe america best valuesso campaign direct extension life’s workit’s idea country society doesn’t work people anymore want fix that thought talk little bit caused problem want fix it actually want start historical anecdote involves another presidential candidate maybe one would expect george romney mitt’s dad ran president auto executive habit saying annual bonuses board wanted give said board directors “i believe anyone make   year adjusted inflation  million mean imagine today think highlights culture society used different top corporate executives didn’t try maximize pay viewed leaders society sure fought things help profits also built interstate highway system guess wonder could look back offer thoughts created old culture seemed work well countryso i’d say roots great depression notion lived period extraordinary inequality right very wealthy come crashing around ears great depression top really kind fingered guys caused crash brought everyone idea was we’re together now always take deep breath say together relative term together among white people together among men still actually see data can’t you country got richer gdp goes up income goes everybody read things company well excited workers are means year raises going little bit bigger words sense shared enterprise ceo says “i’m part leading team we’re gonna together” living — rhetoric also end workers proud put know company well wellcan see way recapture old ethos todayso companies point describe law align it wasn’t cultural thing actually reinforced legal incentives rules worked together let give couple examples look back business roundtable know ginormous businesses get together ceos get together talk business isand think formally ceos members business roundtablethat’s right think that’s right ginormous companies members get together business roundtable describe early s formally described themselves over know cigars fine port actually describe themselvesyeah documents say corporation owes duty shareholders workers customers community located entities stakeholders company end see business roundtable describe obligation ginormous corporations as obligation shareholders nobody elsefull stop job pump greatest number dollars profits increase wealth shareholders means mashing workers dirt problem powerful difference you’re watching law — incentives law — shift time roosevelt comes — first roosevelt gonna trust buster works while kind dies see gilded age second roosevelt comes in franklin roosevelt says i’m gonna pick antitrust tools i’m gonna use them throughout ‘ s ‘ s ‘ s ‘ s ‘ see really strong antitrust enforcement words get big there’s government balances says whoa swallowing rivals eating little businesses don’t pose threat you watch way government places government supports idea corporations maximize profits we’ve gotta make sure competition protected sec strong cop walking beat make sure giant companies cheating either investors customers that’s ideaand sort see government companies reinforce other companies feel like hey there’s cop beat better behave feel like know what they’re going stop us sort gives incentive permission much aggressive everythingyou right focus incentive fact i’ll add it actually starts work way there’s cop beat better mind p’s q’s know competitors tooif there’s cop beat holy — wait know i’m good guy man corporation corporations i’m competing against they’re not one’s going enforce they’re going cheat boy better get start cutting corners too role government it’s either good benign it’s actually good bad terms incentives get adjustedone themes talk show is american people quite progressive economics right look polling wealth tax look polling tax increases rich tax increases corporations minimum wage expanding medicare — linei think it’s different social issues cultural issues think fundamentally divided think even issues could say centerright country much center country leftleaning country think lot people who even though may support wealth tax expanded medicare continue vote republican don’t vote issues it’s interesting you’re former registered republican earlier life right talk make case people economics deeply held reasons — may prolife may want immigration restrictions — they’re going agree issues win people overso i’m gonna make pitch slightly differently think lot people don’t believe actually make change economics politicians stand talk about “oh i’m working people” they’re not don’t make real change think right people told there’s nickel’s worth difference folks washington democrat republican — fact differences social issues none anything help anyone except giant drug companies giant financial companies giant oil companies rightthat’s right it’s people asked weigh real economic change versus social issues we country just disagree instead it’s washington doesn’t work that’s see way see coming really hard fundamental question what’s broken washington doesn’t work democracy majority people see economic problems truly make commitment that’s credible we’re gonna fight fight together make changes know here’s example start wealth tax people get interested say “wow really would willing push back billionaires multi multi multimillionaires people who’ve amassed great fortunes” answer is yeah would here’s part two that let’s talk kind difference could make life wealth tax would produce enough money pay universal child care early education prek pre prek still  trillion leftover think could student loans work need infrastructure know starts feel real now something that’s handwaving pieinthesky feels like real changean outside budget experts said me “you know can’t decide feel warren wealth tax i’ll tell this never answer question campaign pay something answer wealth tax”yes it’s right there start you’re going pay that’s actually heart pointso whole bunch silly criticisms couple policy proposalswell let’s skip silly ones let tell ones weigh little bit is literal sense word radical meaning get root problem radical proposals they’re new they’re innovative one wealth tax currently tax large wealth property tax sort tax middle class —i going say actually i’d like point every homeowner america every owner small family farm paying wealth tax it’s called property tax pay usually lot morewhich is think probably best argument it also proposal put workers corporate boardswith idea reinstilling notion companies exist shareholders yes also workers communities seems substantive criticisms asking government lot new things given amount distrust people government gives confidence government actually take new roles things hasn’t doingthe consumer financial protection bureau went zero  right didn’t consumer agency within year actually stopping frauds forcing big banks pay people back managing consumer complaint hotline made work i’ll tell setting like amazing building agency amazing experience probably best part fact people country showed said “let part this want something bigger myself something important i’ve doing” people applied who’d banking industry people applied straight college people applied retired oh cowboy applied it’s true it’s true story described cowboy banker people applied who’d prosecutors prosecuted kinds criminal behavior wanted chance go cheat people money challenge build agency structure mission really would carry time able walk halls say “who fighting for families across country” would truly built structure so proof pudding little agency forced biggest financial institutions country return  billion directly people cheated take deep breath there actually write checks  billion much cheating didn’t go said worth —i think lot people impression trump totally neutered it think agency still good todayi do look much could doing mick mulvaney everything could take legs underneath it agency may paused aggressive work structure rightand it’s still handling complaints it’s still making difference marketplaceit seems me bigger point terms looking forward is actually think sometimes bigger ideas possible accomplish inspire peopleone ways know campaign playbook particularly president trump go it’ll involve racism you’ve obviously experienced people racist insults used whole controversy native american history said you’re open idea reparations africanamericans slavery reparations native americans make case particular white workers democrats party white people tooso i’ll make argument two ways one think address talk head on cannot pretend racial implication anything happens live america every  wealth middle white family owns median black family owns  wealth generation generation systematic discrimination — example housing still legal s federal government subsidized purchase homes neighborhoods except africanamerican neighborhoods — implications reverberate today got willing address talk head on there’s sweeping rug there’s pretending it’s there think that’s part one talk it part two — look donald trump gets basic idea is let’s set working people working peoplelet’s treat value country wealth country absolutely limited dollar it’s dollar you working person working person martin luther king jr called back s talked setting working people working people nobody would notice really rich people picking pockets think part say going be going turn done try work outlet actually ask quick question universal child care subject recent episode “the argument” there’s lot really like universal child care program like idea builds system better preschools like idea you’re going raise wages childcare workers one concern it’s majority program it’s real concern working class middle class people want stay home kids mom that program doesn’t help themso program puts money early learning programs understand rich people whether they’re home they’ve got kids top notch programs they’re four years old they’re three years old lot they’re still two years old know educational opportunities — educational opportunities mean looks like me they’re playing blocks they’re bumping knocking — important educational opportunities open everybody it don’t go pocket make sure children get opportunities children somebody who’s richcould imagine adding kind tax credit says income certain level stay home kid first year two get boost wellso think it’s interesting idea want see numbers play out course exactly who’d affected true — core part — parents able range decisions open them that’s really heart this fact babies zero five well taken care matter what think what’s going make great america generation now two generations now best investment make zero fives data show us every nickel invest pays individually child throughout lives also collectively us investments kids investments really pay offyeah reduces future welfare spending probably might create billionaires pay wealth taxexactly i’m that know people pay wealth tax goone question actually extends k higher education one differences lot progressives think progressives haven’t tough enough quality public schools think federal government better job — disagree premise want — getting tough poor performers raising quality funding quality educationso i’m going two pitches here first one can’t raise quality education won’t pay teachers can’t raise quality education do like did went back high school ceiling tiles falling school cafeteriayeah roof leaks nobody money fix it partly can’t stand around say “do more more more” give money able with second one particularly want focus higher ed there’s lot work here place tax dollars put risk student loan program yet right department education letting profit colleges example siphon dollars into best substandard educational experiences many many many students consequence people get saddled huge debt little increase income potential lives destroyed debts dischargeable bankruptcy right top fight right table much federal government insist higher standards anyone able get access — school able get access federal student loan program understand profit colleges can’t operate without federal student loan money target principally two groups young people went straight high school military good benefits come ready maybe served four years six years want come out want get college degree pounce kids pounce single moms working two jobs read ads subway pitch idea children children college graduates better children noncollege graduates people sign always sophisticated colleges get deep debt substandard educational programs place right betsy devos secretary education lowering standards day day profit colleges rip students outrageousi agree profit colleges clearly worse public colleges this thing i’d add is public colleges also horrifically high dropout ratesnow would add point i’ve actually pushing long time something called “skin game” colleges skin game amount debt students take actually repayable words use default rate measure whole lot students defaulting either you’re charging much you’re helping prepare life they’ll able pay debt back idea colleges get certification accredited college — way that’s done government that’s done private accrediting agencies — want pause minute — get money colleges accredit anything might wrong system ever tried something like before get accreditation set prices tuition wherever want turns sink students college pays penalty that young people going borrow money come school downside risk they’re leaving school great numbers get always great numbers here’s here’s predict there’s going distribution schools going high repayment rates going much lower repayment rates think ones much lower repayment rates worth look what’s going onand that’s kind accountability talking aboutvery last couple quick things asked listeners would want ask you one question kind cabinet would want form don’t mean individual names one critiques you’ve made obama cabinet thought skewed sort one side democratic coalition would want cabinet mostly reflected views would want cabinet included range views including democrats conservative youi would want cabinet believes change would want cabinet believes make government economy work rich powerful everyone else interested cabinet full former lobbyists executives made fortunes lobbying washington that’s many executives — that’s what’s made successful they’ve done sense want people feel urgency need change vision it i’d add one i’d want risk takers people want kind preside — know it’s really nice dress outfit everyone call mr secretary madam secretary people pitch vision is they’d like accomplish they’d willing get take risk itmitch mcconnell famously said you “nevertheless persisted” people now people tattoos say “nevertheless” “nevertheless persisted” gear ownoh multiple necklaces bracelets multiple artistic renderings kinds different forms paintings — people given gifts got lot good stuffand running president hard unwind fdr cocktail parties ike played bridge obama watched espn day meeting people iowa take mind gamehe’s golden retriever big boy he’s monthsold never met anybody didn’t love kind grounds world reminds priorities important priority is scratch right there right there right behind ear start scratching ear starts leaning falls over could ask something betterwell thank us home thank coming shownow we’re gonna take quick break return michelle ross join debrief michelle ross back going talk conversation senator warren hello michelle rossso ross get sign new agenda warren populismi mean think she’s always interesting sense wellthoughtout theory wrong american capitalism account fix clearly distinct think lot democrats field doing least far right mean sort general sense kind race left democratic field everybody trying come ambitious sweeping proposal etc difference warren emphasizing others emphasizing often others tend saying here’s we’re going spend lot money program x z she’s extent childcare stuff tell she’s interested sort encourage slash force american business class big corporations american capitalists behave kind communitarian slash patriotic way lot doubts specific plan she’s going is think really distinct like know we’re gonna medicare free college know free childcare onwhat would add lot stuff — let’s set aside personally minute — lot agenda actually popular mean look polling wealth tax much popular signaling candidates trying left things like taking away people’s private health insurance that’s think might influentialthis start wondering much policy actually matters all know again talk elizabeth warren i’m going repeat full disclosure husband consulting campaign designed logo terms policy — it’s think policies close ideal — speak powerful democrats time say “well obviously policy elizabeth warren best but” think sort see reflected polling right ideas extremely popular far comprehensive policy vision know sort clear understanding went wrong sort sort mechanisms could summon fix it yet you’ll hear people sort reminds hillary mean purely stylistic sense leads wonder salience policy democratic primary politics alli think voters don’t care greatly rigorous details policy plan sense doesn’t help warren much she’s rigorous candidates think policy though really useful signaling general world view general commitment think challenge signaling general kind thing bernie sanders especially also candidates running left she’s trying figure way sort distinguish signaling others rightright way she’s trying distinguish saying “i plan know things” know sort fills despair politics don’t know much matterswell maybe matters she’s signaling she’s candidate wants change balance power american economy democrats may signaling they’re candidate new programs redistribution obviously redistributionary plans distinctive pitch need deal monopolies need tax know deep deposits wealth need lot regulatory stuff change corporations operate think sense primary test democratic voters want redistribution primarily want free college medicare primarily don’t really care pay it buy warren’s more know we’re going restructure things corporations behave differently approach think that’s that’s distinction she’s trying drawbut ross you’re framing choice democratic voters want want b michelle think point lot voters don’t even make decision all make decision instead based well someone giving speeches age general profile past jobs beenwell know it’s kind like “what’s matter kansas” problem action there’s debate left forever socially conservative lowermiddleclass white voters working class white voters vote condescending liberals like see economic interests say economic interests know kind economic policy preferences least polls focus groups consistently willing set aside cultural issues really believe something gone fundamentally wrong american economy here’s somebody identifying problem who’s looking way people’s lives go rails health care costs credit card debt much holistic understanding gone wrong since around  instead she’s trying kind valiantly say look let’s make debate policy i’m sure maybe kind overestimating thiswell mean think sense ask typical americans — use overused phrase — what’s gone wrong economy would say wages haven’t risen fast enough cost certain goods gone up right simplicity responding concerns saying ok we’re going make college education free we’re going guarantee health care maybe we’re going cut middle class taxes kamala harris proposed middle class tax cut warren hand talking last week two she’s talking big antitrust crackdown internet companies agree there’s sort maybe sophisticated leftwing vision antitrust looms large think understand voters might responsive message says “ok know wages seem stagnant here’s money” message says “oh company way really popular use buy cheap goods bring doorstep time company actually problem we’re going go them”right argument wages seem stagnant companies become responsive shareholders they’re paying much chief executives don’t sense social responsibility mean think people probably intuitively feel thati guess thing would it’s really early mean obama getting crushed clinton point don’t think draw many firm conclusions based polls currently saying we’re still going ask she’s better don’t think it’s referendum policy agenda polling suggests popular think it’s much personally think voters aren’t comfortable fact identified native american past think doesn’t help she’s intellectual spent years harvard professorit’s crazy sort genuine horatio alger story candidate race roots midwestern working class way can’t think politician stature sort similar backstoryyep that’s true guess final thing think need — it’s early — think need think sexism here mean who’s leading polls men right bernie biden harris back far look like potentially even democratic primary — maybe ross would say especially democratic primary — sexism remains significant issuewell one things that’s interesting see many people say like biden first choice bernie second know part maybe two names know think can’t underestimate impact name recognition far out part like “hmm bernie biden common” know like nothing policy wise they’ve got something important commoni stand nonsexism least right now democratic primary voter bernie sanders ran president extremely well relative expectations runner last primary sort historical way republican party worked doesn’t obviously work anymore would considered natural frontrunner going in joe biden vice president eight years president remains extremely popular democratic base elizabeth warren existed prominent intellectual means sort radar screen people like us senator bluest state union arguably whose chief accomplishment consumer financial protection bureau — it’s small thing it’s sort something median primary voter going front center way bernie’s identity biden’s identity would front center mean think many ways warren looks like sort classic paul tsongastype know northeastern liberal academic figure have whether they’re men women always challenging road don’t think surprised isn’t running away nomination point think real story people line work different reasons underestimated bernie biden alongand we’ll get biden future episode soon let’s end policy stuff whoever democratic nominee going adopt one part warren agenda one would rank number onei mean episode explain skeptical universal healthcare douthat goldberg laugh think it’s vulnerable precisely issues raised interview david i’m skeptical one think warren making mistake trying go silicon valley full think smart version warren would separate google especially facebook amazon apple sort make bigger issue facebook google’s stronger monopolies control flow information something apple amazon don’t exercise say look we’re going silicon valley we’re going specific bad actors different kind monopoly amazon trying build longer argument basically that’s piece think warren right go silicon valley think antisilicon valley crusaders need better job basically dividing conquering rather trying take full tech panoply standswell ross whenever go populist like end segment we’ll end we’ll right back weekly recommendations it’s time weekly recommendation give suggestion something take mind politics ross week turn usall right little embarrassing i’m gonna anyway
