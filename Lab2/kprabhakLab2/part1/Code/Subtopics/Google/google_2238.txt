who’s ahead race beat trumpwith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardtand media bias look like trump erai’m david leonhardt “the argument” week take look current list democratic presidential candidatesshe really speaks to sort like aspirations countrythen media bias look like trump agethis — — insane — insane takei’ve never moment thought lost anythingover past weeks handful candidates said running presidenti stand today announce candidacy president united statesi decided run we’ll making formal announcement within next weekyo soy candidato para presidente de los estados unidosi’m filing exploratory committee president united states tonightfor two frontrunners among announced candidates senators kamala harris elizabeth warren outside seem cut cloth two liberal women two liberal states california massachusetts harris warren less similar may seem first new colleague opinion section jamelle bouie he’s keen observer politics he’s going join us discussion i’m going step out i’ll come back segment two jamelle michelle ross raceso jamelle we’re really glad you it’s going trial fire hopefully michelle surviveso let’s start talking kamala harris pretty successful kickoff campaign world frontrunner suddenly lot people talking democratic front runner michelle strong figureyou know ways it’s little bit amorphous right mean it’s like elizabeth warren economic populist agenda history clearly speaks moment degree maybe straddles divides bernie wing party hillary wing party think know immensely compelling personal figure right she’s charismatic beautiful multiracial right mean embodies america that donald trump trying extripate she’s sort pitched candidate resistance right yet time she’s making sort broader systemic critique elizabeth warren she’s making sort like patriotic argument america better thisyou know she’s she’s figure who unlike democrats obvious problems progressive activists arguably work harder possible frontrunners would reassure win people over think that’s rightyeah that’s exactly thought sort willingness say “yeah proposal would abolish private health insurance” prior career prosecutor prosecutor state right africanamericans are everywhere disproportionately targets criminal justice system it’s major obstacle major blemish left wing activists party younger black voters well needs figure way either neutralize opposition left recast career prosecutor something positive think she’s trying both don’t think she’s yet terribly successful regards prosecutor part i’ll interested see much leans direction trying present onboard sort like radical policy thinking circulating within democratic politics said that think harris like one glaring weakness is don’t actually know she’s running president right like she’s charismatic compelling there’s something inherently compelling interesting novel fact highprofile wellconnected black woman ever mount presidential bid that’s important trying figure sort like core problem american society kamala harris think needs attacked overcome united states better represent itself would hard pressed give answer don’t really know answer is know — knew answer barack obama know answer elizabeth warren bernie sanders kamala harris don’t quite know answer is think kind rhetorical challenge next know eleven months so trying really present public critique vision something points larger direction kind like “i think i’d really great president” may well truebut jamelle don’t think she’s sort set as like opponent reactionary ethnonationalism mean it’s not direct implicit criticisms trump trump administration talks what know “our america” isthat’s true it’s implicit think loses don’t know value think ought explicit maybe know i’m one pollsters maybe people advising harris good evidence say embody opposition say anything it don’t know think candidates well served articulate kind clear unambiguous vision want country bei think there’s touch of know sort hillary clinton “america already great” think literally said variation campaign kickoff speech sense sort like trump sort terrible accidental interregnum gotten way gradual upward march progress embodied africanamerican california female senator ascending highest office land let’s get back track think agree jamelle danger assuming kind candidate feel like party nominate win nomination mean was know story marco rubio campaign people running campaign said know “look rubio embodies lot republicans want party that’s going enough carry us victory don’t necessarily need clear argument candidacy line attack another candidate” ended havingcorrect i’m wrong rubio drawing huge crowds right certainly wasn’t getting  people kickoff rally know think reason front runner pundits decided checked lot boxes she’s generating lot real enthusiasmno agree that think mean think wrote last month two months ago going sort try figure early stage likely kind jump front race it’s going harris democratic primary voters course clearly demonstrated looking candidates like kamala harris said that think rubio analogy apt think she’s probably better position part large chunk democratic party looks like kamala harris like profound advantage think problem may candidates start jumping in specifically cory booker think find way distinguish herself booker similarly make kind claim embodies opposition donald trump much forthright kind vision america has it’s sort beloved community united states bereft sort fellow feeling that’s manifest politics et cetera et cetera right absence sort anyone comparable kind following think harris looks strong booker jumps in bernie jumps in right like also politicians think — kind parenthetical — similar ways it’s easy miss extent harris dedicated mass following think booker one bernie certainly does jump think harris find way keep don’t think kind herjamelle i’m curious share feeling sort like reluctantly like guiltily drawn harris mean editorial meeting podcast mentioned sometimes feel like know like distracted boyfriend meme who know one hand i’m know elizabeth warren i’ve said show before know husband working elizabeth warren and know we’re like conway’s right like wouldn’t work didn’t believe about totally take critiques kamala harris heart yet saw know rally — sunday know like brings lot feelings me like there’s part just know really speaks my sort like aspirations countryso don’t think i’ve similar experience there mean think sort intellectually see harris compelling candidate i’ve least persuaded really missing american politics a like systemic critique american capitalism — guess way get talking warren right warren offers way may even substantively trenchant bernie sanders offer oh think — think absolutely true mean mostly she’s kind — seems like she’s thought mechanics things much moreright that’s kind like attracts elizabeth warren like think she’s perfectly capable politician extremely superstitious think think she’d perfect weren’t massachusetts track record party electing president massachusetts bad laughswell let push guys little bit though think there’s question existing field really potential field warren one clearer arguments president one clearer agendas everybody agrees she’s ready president day one think way can’t sure democratic — potential democratic nominees are i’m looking — washington post interesting presidential poll  instead giving people list candidates asked democratic primary voters volunteer name say opinion one lesson poll field incredibly open percent opinion ask people people gave preference joe biden percent harris percent is again case potentially catching fire early everybody else clustered percent elizabeth warren’s percent elizabeth warren percenti mean guess she’s simultaneously around outside dc like outside people really politics sort like major public figure moment know “nevertheless persisted” moment think may something breakout moment her i’m sure kind public impact harris hadto big moment far engineered herself native american sort attempted rebuttal trump think it’s fair say didn’t go well bouie laughs think — mean seriously think — mean wouldn’t surprised average democratic voter right now that’s drag support question memory sort wear course next nine months soi don’t think does mean i’m sort — blunder think it’s sort of it’s one blunders may end weighing heavily general election primary think democratic primary voters probably get past it problem think there’s this know there’s attack warren basically sort gamed identity politics get ahead might end potent general electionyou don’t think it’s potent democratic primary tooi don’t know mean what’s difficult trying game things i’m sure anymore things catch fire way media social media thus like broader universe people things don’t like sense gauge anymore imagine situation warren gains ground well debates beginning maybe move away larger pack warren opponents begin circulating back social media becomes object critique from say native american groups people see allies native american groups virtue kind social media conflict becomes media story becomes national story deal it maybe happensso we’ve talking harris warren they’re two front runnerish candidates who’ve jumped race let’s wrap choosing another candidate either minor candidate deserves attention they’re getting someone who’s underrated current analysis jamelle want go firstsure think looking field actual potential candidates think cory booker probably underrated say he similar harris fact kind actual following among democratic voters he’s always indemand surrogate across country think booker taking steps try fix reputation wall street skeptics offering kind ambitious policies signing like sandersadjacent agenda know think he’s kind fallen wayside somewhat would say going to know say put money someone win better expect would bookeryou know i’m interested kirsten gillibrand don’t know strategy winning one think it’s interesting field several women she’s really pitching like feminist candidate she’s built network women local elected office country does think also following extent wonder sort splits difference kamala harris elizabeth warren right think she’s able speak lot members “the resistance” are like her middleaged mothers morally outraged trump somewhat radicalized experience trump administrationi think that’s good choice well i’m gonna say word one minor candidates hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard want say word incredibly weird profile hindu daughter antisame sex marriage activist sort wouldbe spokeswoman antiwar portion bernie left she’s attacked apologist assad regime she’s hawaii she’s veteran she’s young telegenic attractive it’s strange combination combines weird mix far left positions cultural foreign policy stuff appeals conservatives far right it’s weird mix obviously she’s going democratic nominee president wouldn’t surprised ended playing bizarre role anyway jamelle thank much joining uswe’re going take quick break now come back david rejoin us talk mediai’m back michelle ross we’re going talk big media controversies last weeks one buzzfeed news scoop may actually scoop russia investigationpresident trump directed michael cohen lie testimony congress negotiations build trump tower moscowshortly came out robert mueller’s office publicly denounced scoopin extremely rare move mueller’s team released statement denying reportthe big controversy course involved students covington catholic came kentucky washington encounter steps lincoln memorial native american activist drums chanting ross you’re gonna get first word know fiery take media controversies michelle excited take apart you’re doneokay here’s rant think recurring temptations media faces age trump saw two major ones work controversies last couple weeks first temptation leap story seems like it’s going finally provide slam dunk russiarelated evidence impeachment donald trump buzzfeed story latest long line scoops going back scoops related michael cohen supposedly going prague paul manafort supposedly meeting julian assange reported single outlet recycled twitter cable news ecosystem maybe aren’t true happens it’s problem media’s credibility temptation temptation leap sort cultural culture war story seems sort easy privileged white male villains serve sort embodiment everything that’s wrong whiteness white privilege age trump isn’t trump era phenomenon goes back famous rolling stone story rape university virginia turned bogus think undercurrent kavanaugh hearings think way media leaped story seemed bunch white teenagers mobbing native american activist turned way complicated good example stories media wants true runs way quickly damages credibility processthe part want respond part russia stories because know say stories proved true that’s really case mean don’t know exactly buzzfeed story trump directing michael cohen lie — part mueller investigation refuting statement sort vague mean ways nothing come forward disprove stories we’re sort saying “well second tier outlets nobody else got really believe it” know i’m just i’m sure that’s case know mcclatchy broken ton news trumprussia front actually think we’ve seen lot russian reporting turned true start seeing sort fleshed indictments right mean michael cohen charged lying congress saw know indictment sort walking us plans trump tower moscow well reported buzzfeed mean like really letter — hadn’t confirmed we’re seeing sort confirmed indictment know months months later think we’ve seen stories started media see confirmed series indictmentswell mean take wonderful employer example think run iraq war instance period new york times reporters getting lot scoops weren’t reported elsewhere fit particular narrative — case prowar proinvade iraq narrative fact scoops weren’t corroborated elsewhere actually turn really meaningful like i’m not i’m trying cast aspersions guardian mcclatchy buzzfeed particular think general scoops really big deals relate ongoing investigation every major newspaper lots sources come sort hang there unconfirmed long periods time treated certain amount suspicion think would say newspaper well outletsi think you’re little unfair here ross mean first reporting stuff really hard right you’re dealing foreign intelligence services you’re dealing lot people who’ve spent decades lying like roger stone michael cohen yet hard is can’t name single story washington post gotten wrong major way can’t name single story new york times gotten wrong major way can’t name single story lot organizations gotten wrong major way them—actually david let interrupt name story new york times got wrong major way story — written campaign — fbi saw links trump russia right like sort like big journalistic error this know recent history think cuts sort ross’s argumentthat’s totally fair michelle think yes we’re left stories unconfirmed probably closer skepticism ross whether they’re going true haven’t yet confirmed others it’s like news organizations running stories so—well that’s one area — part rant media ecosystem rather outlets themselvesmeaning social media also meaning all cable news right yes buzzfeed story comes newspaper newspapers don’t immediately report it’s confirmed reporters can’t confirm it right mean — read buzzfeed read new york times read washington post would sense that ok unconfirmed story one place reported shouldn’t put much stock it” live maybe political journalists think people well world twitter morning shows cable on it’s like “well talk scoop it’s there” know spend sort of hours world default assumption is iti guess ross would quibble somehow media making big mistakes here actually think much media sober dealing buzzfeed report wanted say lots trump’s opponents quick believe buzzfeed story would agree that actually think large parts media among cautious whether buzzfeed story true we’re still cautious whether it’s truei disagree don’t blame like random hyperresistancey friends retweeting buzzfeed scoop sort hopeful sense—oh sure yeah absolutely michelle i’m friends everybody everybodyso anyway don’t blame—laughs don’t blame people mentality leaping scoops like “is moment moment national nightmare over” blame journalists twitter real journalists sort upcycling stories certain intensity cable news producers upcycling on yes lots institutions included good job chasing down level hysteria press especially twitter cable news leans intookay think agree aspects press it also agree that’s mistake let’s move second case look covington catholic case got much attention assume listeners familiar now listen episode “the daily” podcast go online read number things you’re not there’s room media reflection russia stuff case yes absolutely huge numbers people leaped blame students covington catholic bad kids guess would say is think you’re wearing make america great hat tshirt can’t total innocence kids were that’s symbol outwardly racist presidential campaign lifetime don’t think wear pretend otherwise hats shirts didn’t see kids—oh “tomahawk chops” mean come on i’ve watched lot footage right mean sort understand why first exposure like “oh god kids swarmed man know nowhere proves sort feral nature young maga generation” would say “no complicated” feel like time came story everybody saying “oh this viral twitter thing debunked fact kids nothing wrong” watch videos kids terrifying know looked like like angry white bread mob making fun native american man it’s certainly true approached them instead vice versa way behaved was thought despicabledespicable is— is— insane— insane take couple kids “tomahawk chops” some i’m sure know it’s gang high schoolers roaming washington mall i’m sure despicable things said despicable things they’re teenage boys bunch teenage boys getting know group black nationalists  us who’ve lived washington dc gotten used group know yelling imprecations get metro you’re bunch kids like random school kentucky idea what’s going on you’re waiting meet bus guys start yelling homophobic slurs you mean was like colossal like culture war identity politics like worldscolliding kind insanity perfect kind media freakout describing behavior despicable seems understand don’t understand guess kind reaction feels like reaction to said beginning like idea like feral white male privilegeagain idea sort innocent ridiculous confrontation clashing signifiers also seems like whitewashross thing want push you — i’ll admit i’m playing “what aboutism” here huge numbers people left engage version reflection this right people left came different places michelle you’re one place i’m another large numbers people basically say “hey know what got wrong initially” strikes something don’t really see much right don’t see lot people right versions on say birtherism obama crazy conspiracy theories occupy vast amounts time fox news seems like end much more kind of wringing hands versions left going far media accept notion right wing media going filled nonfact based crazy stuff without reflectionwell two — let make two points ok one think division within right terms level reflectiveness get think kind culture war controversies and know mean think equivalent thing would like media covers young black males something get big difference writers national review defunct weekly standard would handle it fox news talk radio would handle it think reflection right agree there’s big segment right wing ecosystem doesn’t engage much reflection time big chunk media i’m critiquing left media think lot immediate mainstream news stories written story lot immediate cnn coverage ridiculous coverage outlets left outlets make claim mainstream outlets think right’s critique mainstream media think often correct mainstream media lot virtues correct itself lot things right makes mistakes right’s view — especially cultural war related stuff — it’s always racing one particular directionthat may right don’t think it’s right straight political stories think straight political stories media airs right left right michelle mentioned media got wrong important russia was media think overplayed hillary clinton’s emails mentioned ross media banged drums wars without exactly meaning iraq think straight politics stuff don’t think errors go one way agree cultural stuff do often not go one wayi think overcorrection covington catholic story distortion although know certainly don’t want anything i’m saying construed way defensive like doxxing kids even huge amount significance strange momentary standoff took broader culture right kind fundamentally comes back incredibly toxic nature twitter problem politics politics societies world right mean it’s like machine we’ve invented generating multiplying anger know sort intermittent reward structure slot machine except comes like indignation instead money think that know sort either figure deal twitter or know wish somebody would figure burn ground ross laughswell we’ve done enough selfflaggelating segment want hear criticisms media are don’t give us call  give us criticism mainstream media today may play show it’s time weekly recommendation something meant take mind politics media stressful stuff michelle get go week usmy recommendation elope one thing never regretted one best decisions ever made eloping taking money husband would spent wedding instead spending trip around world understand know ability that take trip around world function extreme privilege cost less people spend weddings was know one best decisions i’ve ever made also think good way get marriage good footso  last thing want criticize wedding ceremony michelle one question it is feel like missing something essentially saying vows front closest friends biggest argument weddingso closest friends there like basically husband sort like called people knew morning like “we’re going city hall want come know couple hours” know i’m  i’m someone ever sat around fantasizing wedding or know never thought lost anythingwhat spun really romantic right idea running away getting married eloping one thing would hard time community aspect guys know well enough know don’t use word “sacred” often think sacred thing i’ve ever done say wedding vows wife front basically collected friends familyand correct reactionary  repeat  take this course money spent order compensate collapsing sense tradition sacred people don’t senses lives extent should one moment comes along still residue sacral it people like “well literally make heaven earth spare expense” on fact rising costs american weddings linked decline marriage institution paradoxical really way michelle laughswell
