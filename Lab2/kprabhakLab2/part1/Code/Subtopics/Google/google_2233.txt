trump real national emergencywith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardtand amazon abandoning new york means city — countryi’m david leonhardt “the argument” weekthe white house strongly defending president trump’s declaration national emergency usmexico borderand what’s happening trump he’s got fingers burner keeps twisting knob random directionsthen amazon pulling queens good thingyou want come new york city well rest world get numberi hear thing again read it willlast week president trump finally he’d threatening weeks declared national emergency fund wall usmexico borderwe’re talking invasion country drugs human traffickers types criminals gangsdemocrats even republicans condemned move calling unconstitutional abuse authority sixteen states suing block declaration whole fight plays one big questions ross michelle trump frightening authoritarian president flailing incompetent president must say national emergency pushes toward incompetent option it’s still clear wall ever built is really affect immigration policy trump doesn’t anywhere near unified republican support either take another sign trump’s weakness michelle i’m wondering think i’m blaséyou know go back forth right said like frightening authoritarian flailing incompetent don’t remember exact language think answer both look countries undergone transformation liberal democracy authoritarianism know doesn’t happen one fell swoop often happens period years one hand seems like trump weak kind disengaged details governing actually institute transformation time hollowed lot government normalized kind authoritarian rhetoric used unprecedented normalized think sort like extralegal mode governing so know part what’s happened trump — talk time — froginapot phenomenon actions would created huge amount shock outrage year ago two years ago become inured to everybody rolls eyes when example accuses former acting director fbi treason emergency declaration maybe isn’t scary it’s going make much easier next one next one might circumstances lot alarmingi want take michelle’s metaphor suggest something little different it basically course multiple presidencies comes executive power call “imperial presidency” we’ve kind boilingthefrog situation immense consolidation executive power foreign policy national security  george w bush pushed barack obama basically embraced substantial expansion checked courts various ways presidential power domestic policy pushed obama second term around health care climate policy immigration sort frog boiled slowly what’s happening trump he’s got fingers burner keeps twisting knob random directions heat keeps flaring frog keeps jumping around even though water isn’t necessarily getting hotter — may terrible metaphor i’m trying say think real danger here plausible danger really politically effective presidents make power grabs work trump sort exposing works really crude ridiculous it think it’s actually weakening imperial presidency various ways making authoritarian scenario less likely would sophisticated future imperial presidenti think — think danger long run basically american democracy constitutional system devolving order vestigial legislature doesn’t really anything executive claims power nobody else claiming power ends getting endless fights supreme court think dynamic continued trump think it’s overt transparent crude people much aware trump isn’t good bush obama did cloaking power grabs sort of know consensusoriented rhetoric on people aware what’s actually happeningone fundamentally frightening things wall declaration it’s based racist lie know — sort hallmark authoritarian governments both know kind make lies create government policies instantiate lies that’s very different obama going around mitch mcconnell establish dacaand actually number one fear here — agree michelle based racist lie there’s another court case similar it’s attempt add question census citizenship status administration’s lies documented federal court worry little bit idea president makes lie courts feel need say well we’ll meet halfway one fear hereso mean — think really interesting question right agree trump transparent flagrant liar normal president would be big change time it’s clear it’s worrisome president tells big flagrant lies can’t get funding wants congress appropriates extra funding build miles fencing along rio grande border area terrifying president basically says ignore congress launch military interventions overseas without congressional authority obama libya mean understand lies frightening time actual policies much bigger dealbut guess feel — michelle assume agree — presidents dealing reality obama did it’s quite different they’re making emergency trying it it’s much length fence he’s building it’s inventing whole cloth security crisis border trying something respond political reasons whereas really upset obama overreached climate obama wasn’t making climate change pushed boundaries executive authority sort don’t think ignore distinctionyeah it’s whether sort pretext to again instantiate hallucinatory vision world — mean part fundamental difference that know feeling threat american liberal democracy come trump republican party writ large barack obama responding broader breakdown republican party’s willingness let nonrepublicans govern know just don’t think blame barack obama claiming unilateral power — least wouldn’t blame barack obama kind claiming whatever unilateral power could saw republicans basically decided democrats don’t right govern going anything stop democrats governingbut literally argument like julius caesar crossing rubicon right like it’s it’s caesar’s fault senate nest corruption vice unfairly wants prosecute fighting wars glory rome choice march capital want clear provocative still case there right like argument fact evolution imperial presidency necessary right like america really republic anymore really empire need president declare national emergencies willy nilly that’s way anything ever gets done legislature basically exists exist like mild check executive overreachno i’m going road you right i’m making argument i’m making argument treating two parties — obstructionism sort willingness subvert norms liberal democracy — think there’s argument treating symmetrical so know think republican party become authoritarian illiberal antidemocratic movement know place blame breakdown separation powers themso want think context another headline week andrew mccabe former deputy fbi director admitted colleagues justice department talked using th amendment remove president trump office trump fired back accusing mccabe accusing deputy attorney general rod rosenstein treason kind amazing deputy attorney general ross know level really think trump different obama bush mean wrote column —you endorse mccabe option were still there still think th amendment cabinet vice president vote remove president something that’s tablei think argument actually flows sort provocatively saying michelle right imperial presidency becomes important man actually holds immense power sort least semicompetent exercise it would sort caesarest case using th amendment remove ineffective caesars lot sympathy whatever going mccabe’s mind people justice department obviously writing this know “consider th amendment” column around time first couple months trump’s administration period everything chaos fired comey objectively kind insane thing obvious time created whole mueller investigation basically — looked like fire sessions moment gave appearance man incapable exercising office presidency two years later think it’s clear unfit remains people around — like didn’t fire sessions right hasn’t fired — hasn’t tried fire mueller —he fired normal sort of months know get replacement lined kind way rather sort insane cascading behavior way think there’s evidence last two years people around trump able restrain channel ways strongly weakens will argument removing via th amendment wouldn’t write column way todaybut like classic sort froginthepot argument right everything people afraid happening moment happened took longer people anticipated right sort defenestrated leadership fbi many intelligence agencies it’s taken longer slowly removed possible checks power know rod rosenstein leave new attorney general william barr refusing recuse whose kind previous claim fame role played pardon various people who’d convicted role iran contra right we’re getting point he’s kind creating structure impunity it’s rather taking months it’s taken couple yearsi guess think comes th amendment — is listeners don’t know mechanism remove president incapacity — actually big difference scale chaos involved first months trump now think trump now removed obstacles power proceed things like fire mueller anything else like mechanism response natural mechanism would impeachment th amendment behavior would suggest man sort control actions malign way distinction makes sense think think even michelle’s worst case scenario right aren’t th amendment territory we’re impeachment territorylet’s end started wall thinks actually going happen courts going block wall let version go through michelleyou know think gotten really used kind relying courts check trump’s authoritarian impulses one thing that’s happening last two years transformation courts including know putting kavanaugh — shown total partisan hack — supreme court know knows mean hopefully chief justice roberts want maintain sort institutional legitimacy think institutional legitimacy less less safeguard new judge who’s confirmedi think trump little bit building claims power existing law emergency declaration still litigated courts bernard sanders sworn next president united states leonhardt laughsand obviously part trump wants right clearly trump wants wall campaign wants able say he’s made progress also he’s stymied enough needs reelected order finish wallok leave there doubt we’ll coming back bunch related topics including william barr attorney general think way decides oversee mueller investigation mentioned going one really big questions beginning term we’re going take quick break right back talk amazon new york city we’re back we’re going talk amazon company announced last week abandoning plans build major office complex long island city queensthe company abruptly announced it’s pulling growing opposition lawmakers union leaders activistsamazon decided would difficult deal progressive politicians activists new york criticizing corporate subsidies company received come city progressives surprisingly celebrating amazon’s decision many people worried new york needlessly damaged economy scaring away amazon joining us talk amazon week mara gay colleague opinion writes new york times editorial board mara welcome back “the argument”so help us understand particularly times editorial board quite disappointed outcome heresure actually weighed twice first deal immediately announced saying deal good deal didn’t think enough public input amazon didn’t actually give city enough needs terms infrastructure transit needs decision amazon last week abrupt decision pull new york disappointing felt city hostile inhospitable even conversation amazon make best deal could get next year supposed year long process city state amazon company would sit would hammer details get best deal sides never happened lot kind grandstanding local elected officials felt cut deal lot also newlyelected progressives felt didn’t think really wealthy company get huge incentive packages general lot problems fact deal done kind secret behind closed doors presented public input sad see  jobs go could productive conversation didn’t happenso agree grandstanding silly right basically capitalism evil agree  jobs would helped queens yet still found cheering think whole game companies hold local governments — really taxpayers — subsidies it’s terrible economic policy doesn’t anything grow economy cities bidding other even new york takes modest hit — it’s modest it’s  jobs city four million jobs — guess think larger principle here that’s cities starting get little bit aggressive saying companies try hold up i’m really pleased it think new york country favor hereyou know hear you think though projected billion revenue deal years even half materialized that’s money could used city pay address massive infrastructure needs need fix new york city subway need build housing actually think governor mayor really brokered deal along amazon presented agreement along commitment address subway crisis housing crisis could example — let’s say amazon gives gift half billion housing half billion subway governor commits spending know half projected  billion revenue many years direct toward issues think would different conversation think corporations touch think public officials case specifically governor cuomo mayor de blasio extremely touch people concerned about new york city doesn’t jobs problem income inequality problem wages problemmara given that weren’t people right angry right things you’re talking about commitments use revenue fix subways address affordable housing weren’t plan obviously going winners proposal know one things that’s interesting seeing kind anger local public housing tenants association know wanted plan thought lot them lot people right reason believe going priced neighborhoodthey reason believe subways going become even unbearable think people maybe outside new york city — one things don’t know much filters through kind complete breakdown reliability subways completely changed texture daily life city neighborhood lack investment like new schools sorts civic infrastructure need there’s influx new people know son didn’t get zoned kindergarten example people live real reason believe they’re going losers influx really highlypaid new jobs aren’t necessarily going them coming guarantee money going go back community back infrastructureyeah think — great points share lot concerns frank process beginning things could addressed state landuse process next year year half think people didn’t realize deal done behind closed doors middle night presented public governor essentially said “here go aren’t thanking us” quickly clear — all everyone involved misjudged appetite concerns really are say disappointment really gross financial illiteracy city state around notion giving amazon three billion dollars though going hand  billion cash even though tax benefit people twitter saying well use three billion dollars subway instead know they’re cheering that’s quite would worked right don’t want overstate think definitely think city state friendlier business also negotiate make sure we’re getting need state citythere’s think there’s real fascinating parallel sort lot especially newlyelected progressive politicians stuff certain kind like tea party activist right like eight nine years ago right dynamic people newly elected making arguments effectively crony capitalism mix kind sincere civic mindedness certain kind economic illiteracy right think sort present tea party spades what’s interesting read like i’ve reading lot conservative critiques alexandria ocasiocortez know she’s always lightning rod also know antiamazon politicians critiques know conservatives sort field day making fun anticorporate socialists drove amazon new york tea party legislator killing similar deal red state conservatives would cheering lot center left pundits would like oh look tea party activists red states know they’re shooting economies foot again don’t really point exactly — all laughno no think there’s little bit strange bedfellows lot kind interesting philosophical debates going on also think something gotten missed would say mainstream democrats that locally speaking lot politicians new york came deal vociferously — people actually put office gentrifiers millennials middle class upper middle class highlyeducated voters upset trump also are know oftentimes — like frankly — millennials really drawn big cities like new york can’t really afford live there alexandria ocasiocortez perfect example this wasn’t elected poorest folks district although voted her gentrifiers point think politicians underestimated anxiety group people large growing pretty powerful vote politicians represent them mean house grew prospect heights brooklyn could never afford live there it’s bed breakfast ok all laugh it’s pretty wild can’t afford live neighborhoods cities grew in deep anxiety people going live aren’t rich also don’t live public housing friend who’s paying   month onebedroom astoria terrified amazon coming can’t afford  month figured would don’t think she’s crazy kind anxiety affordable housing subway real think one state certainly governor mayor really understood depth affects people’s lives that’s partially don’t ride subway another story another timeone interesting pieces read wired zachary karabell argued amazon live regret this look populist strains we’re talking from really right center left tech companies going grapple strains lot frustrated people there opportunity so amazon’s long term going able say oh might get hands dirty we’re outta herei agree one frustrations initial deal amazon came new york city new york city said we’re going offer five million dollars workforce development goldberg leonhardt laugh found — said know offense kansas kansas feeling that know want come new york city well rest world get number pay full share gay goldberg laugh think lot people felt way think sense of hey since beg people come new york that’s larger conversation that’s happening nationally hope going less handwringing less grandstanding thoughtfulness attract right employers right businesses don’t want treat everyone way treated amazon city council want get better deals companies look like conversationswell mara mentioned de blasio cuomo even people sympathetic criticisms amazon seems quite clear didn’t handle well really think there’s big opportunity politicians right left particularly
