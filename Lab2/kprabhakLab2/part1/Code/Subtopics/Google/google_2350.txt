science experiments frigid temperatures yearold son gus friend eren  learned wednesday tested handful popular coldweather experiments science doesn’t always follow neat path viral videoseveral videos demonstrate superchill soda similar experiment instantly freezes water shook two oneliter bottles sprite placed outside front door phone told minus degrees fahrenheit also put small bottle spring water alongside test instantice trickthe idea try cool soda water freezing point without turning solid without impurities found tap water nothing start nucleation process causes water freeze delivering supercooled liquid that jostled disturbed instantly turn slushy icebut two hours later bottles outside house already halfway solid eren gus yearold daughter hildy didn’t seem care slurped cups stuff“what learn today” husband alex said “the internet broken”olivia castellini senior exhibit developer museum science industry chicago offered several possible explanations spring water might pure enough may waited long next time recommended timing long took freeze one bottle putting another bottle returning minutes earlier catch liquid exactly moment “you find right amount time super cool it” dr castellini saidthis experiment designed show volume gas expands warms contracts cools method blow balloons warm air expose cold air deflate reinflate return warm air reason car tires deflate cold weather said michael kennedy research professor director northwestern university’s science society science education centerwe inflated half dozen balloons inside bundled went outside wait shrink minus degree windchill waited gus eren decided bury balloons snow bank hildy’s flew streetwhen could longer feel noses put remaining balloons bag tied door handle rushed inside minutes balloons deflated slightly realized hadn’t scientific might wise first measure balloons’ original circumference exampleonce back inside balloons return previous shape time adults cared child scientists wanted sprite slushiesdr castellini recommended tying string around balloons placing outside window watch comfort home string falls off they’ve shrunkof coldweather experiments one looking forward frozenbubble trick online videos magical demonstrating normally ethereal soap bubble hardens lacy globe temperature rightwe tried two versions bubble wands — traditional wand small round opening large oblong variety designed bigger bubblesonce outside wands created perfect bubbles hard get look wind whipped street still fun watch pop flew wands leaving frozen skins dropped ground waited long bubble solution froze wand creating translucent pane could poke fingersbubbles dr castellini said really “water soap sandwich” soap encasing layer water warmer weather air inside bubble expands warms popping bubble gets far cold weather water sandwiched inside soap chance freeze bubble popsdr kennedy suggested experimenting different solutions create longestlasting bubbles many people add glycerin gives bubble strength saidthis trick resurfaces nearly every cold snap along inevitable safety warnings to riff jim croce don’t throw wind“the cool thing water exist liquid solid gas states time” dr castellini said throwing boiling water frigid air said “you’re manipulating transition” cold air can’t absorb water way warm air can water thrown go somewhere — freezes tiny droplets falls ground dramatic cloudthe experiment works best extremely cold air certainly wednesday repeated experiment four times — throwing half cup boiling water steel travel mug — time water dissipated billowing puff

expected slightly warmer minus degree school still canceled “but that’s really fun science didn’t get results expect” dr kennedy said “you start asking questions didn’t get thought”“at heart science
