instant custom connected future medical deviceswhen jeff dachis suddenly unexpectedly learned type diabetes age september  stunned all ran marathons followed healthy diet never inkling medical troubles previous annual physicals“i went doctor got six minutes nurse practitioner insulin pen prescription pat back door” mr dachis said “i terrified idea condition address it”feeling confused scared decided leverage expertise digital marketing technology big data analytics create company one drop helps diabetics understand manage diseasethe one drop system combines sensors app bluetooth glucose meter track monitor diabetic’s blood glucose levels food exercise medication uses artificial intelligence predict person’s blood glucose level next hours even suggests ways person control fluctuations walking exercising offset high sugar levels — eating candy bar raise low glucose levels users also text diabetes coach questions real timewith million americans living diabetes mr dachis said knew potential market technology big indeed one million people downloaded app date saidone drop among surging number companies using “internet things” also known iot technology create new treatments health care sector“advances like robotics nanotechnology genetic engineering d printing artificial intelligence iot fueling exciting era within health care innovation” said jeff becker senior analyst health care it expert forrester “many efforts undoubtedly fall flat could end transformative xray itself”about percent consumers surveyed united states said technology important managing health according report accenturethe latest techrelated medical treatment advances run gamut implants help paralyzed people walk smart pills detect patients fail take medicationspinal cord research took major step forward yearold man paralyzed chest since snowmobile accident  able walk distance football field help rolling walker milestone published nature medicine last fall came team researchers mayo clinic implanted epidural electrical stimulator device mans lower spine gave six months intensive physical therapy“this revolutionary breakthrough” said kendall lee neurosurgeon director neural engineering laboratories mayo clinic said device far successfully implanted two peoplewhile implant isn’t cure offers hope millions paralyzed people around world dr lee careful note technology still time away publicly available“we able study fda’s investigational device exemption” dr lee said “this something general population yet”at least three different research groups — mayo

proteus digital health create digital smart pill otsuka’s abilify medication used treat schizophrenia bipolar disorder depression abilify mycite pill rolled next months embedded sensor that’s activated stomach acids sensor tracked patch worn person’s stomach sends information smartphone app patient doctor track medication taken — even send notifications hasn’tbut technology goes far beyond pilltaking reminders said andrew thompson cofounder president chief executive proteus digital health sensor patch also tracks physical activity heart rate rest patterns metrics help doctors patients know whether medication working right dose prescribedthe abilify mycite pill doesn’t come cheap cost   month significantly  to amonth cost generic version abilify pill however patients would take digital pill two three months — enough time collect data pilltaking adherence dosage health impact revise treatment plan andrew wright otsuka’s vice president digital medicine saidefforts underway proteus otsuka add technology pills chronic conditions mr thompson believes it’s future“years grandchildren children incredulous put things body didn’t know real fake right dose wrong dose indate outofdate” mr thompson said “so yes eventually every drug everywhere”in world prosthetics scientists found way tetraplegics — paralyzed neck — feel touch electrically stimulating parts brain paralysis mean loss control feeling affected areas prosthetics return motor function sensing requires treatment nervous system itselfinitially challenge seemed daunting considering brain contains billion neurons matching neurons control sensory nerves prosthetic hands arms tough said sliman bensmaia associate professor department organismal biology anatomy university chicago part research team surgically placing electrode implant brain team able electrically stimulate portions brain controlled sensation allowing patient feel size shape texture objects tell finger touchedplans works expand human trials university pittsburgh johns hopkins university university chicago biggest challenge now making brain implant wireless upgrading doesn’t wear five years“you can’t brain surgery every years” dr bensmaia said “we need array implant technology lasts lifetime”dr bensmaia said brain implant technology could someday farreaching applications improving memory retrieving information fasteranother hot area use d printers create patientspecific medical devices like knee joints spinal implants printers make faster easier cheaper make customized medical devices based patient’s mri ct scans“they made onefifth onetenth” time traditional custommade devices made said scott hollister professor department biomedical engineering georgia institute technology emory university d printed devices often fit far better cause fewer complications require shorter recovery period offtheshelf joint replacements come sizes small medium largeat least dprinted devices received fda approval  although use largely confined academic research hospitalswhile many breakthrough technologies shown promise clinical trials experts caution there’s guarantee they’ll ever make marketmr becker forrester analyst cited disastrous example theranos made false claims years revolutionary bloodtesting technology required small amount blood company raised  million valued  billion peak  made founder elizabeth holmes billionaire collapsing scientists regulators discovered technology didn’t work“theranos pockmark health care it” mr becker saidbut sometimes it’s malicious — it’s promising science doesn’t pan outin  google x lab called verily unveiled news — much fanfare — developing smart contact lens could monitor blood glucose levels realtime measuring tear fluid eye company’s partner project novartis said expected device store shelves within five years“this huge news — holy grail life sciences — something everybody wanted first bring market” mr becker saidbut then “we waited updates nothing came — radio silence” last november company announced project scrapped inconsistent testing results“so clearly science wasn’t there” mr becker said “they prematurely announced it got excited it made big splash naught”
