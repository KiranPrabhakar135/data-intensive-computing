catholic church redeem itselfwith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardti’m ross douthat “the argument” week universal prek liberal pipe dreamand place gay priests catholic churchi think need healthier gay priesthood put waybut ones come like really read actually look forward getting themuniversal prek always tends show progressive policy wish liststhe challenge finding reliable affordable child care huge boulder wedged firmly women million opportunities there applauseadvocates promise help level playing field kids making early education accessible say would lead range related effects would really good society everyone including me convinced universal prek universally good week colleague mara gay join us mara writes new york politics times hey mara welcome backso mara talk little universal prek looks like places america it like now new york citysure considered mayor bill de blasio’s greatest achievement office essentially  elected  kids enrolled prek today  children enrolled prek it’s program lot problems it’s difficult implement it’s also program that’s heralded giving thousands children better start life head start program going decades back federal program help low income children access preschool early learning programs was many studies seen successful depending implemented really continuation city levelmichelle you’re actually new york city program right kids itright well yeah mean son went universal prek daughter’s now know it’s probably reason always de blasio border mean created basically whole new school system short period time it’s transformative lot families know family’s super privileged really removed huge burden us imagine help people without resources honest feel like prek often — universal prek often justified terms impact school readiness us important thing prek it’s form subsidized child care know daughter preschool yearolds subsidized paying   year sudden we’re paying anymoreross conservatives think prek one best things government do sense you’re among conservatives rightwell mean first sort personal disclosures right used live washington dc universal prek availed universal prek year living there sort deepseeded ideological aversion putting kids daycare put kids daycare said think case skepticism sort twofold first think michelle probably somewhat agree think there’s sort overselling extent prek prepares kids school levels playing field leads increased economic opportunity road lot evidence head start programs past programs work really well they’re small scale dedicated group people running them scale badly effects diminish bigger get look one biggest experiments universal prek something quebec — know great socialist neighbor north — starting  big provincewide universal prek program big study group economists couple years ago showed lot measures child preparedness child wellbeing actually declined kids program doesn’t tell us anything new york least tells us difficult build sort educationally and matter emotionally effective program think there’s lot reason skepticism universal prek big effects kids perform school road economic opportunity on case really boils to know people need child care agree people need child care think it’s much reasonable build programs don’t basically discriminate families parent staying home kids extent could talked universal prek program would want look like something like nat bruenig runs small outfit called people’s policy project put universal prek program also provides subsidy mothers fathers providing care home basically tries maintain level playing field stayathome parents parttime parents parents work full timebut could could easily say public school discriminates homeschooling parents mean it’s nature public goods everybody avails them mean that’s sort fundamentally redistribution worksyes think there’s way redistribution doesn’t inherent bias stayathome parents program country said universal prek also going give tax credit stayathome parents certain income better one say hey know what want stay home take care kid you’re working class don’t help you want put kid daycare prek help youi mean new york city experience there’s vast disparity income benefits teachers prek programs one neighborhood may prek program teachers making   year   year more another neighborhood communitybased program teachers making       year every prek same time think that’s infrastructure certainly improved upon also would say michelle’s point huge benefit many working parents especially couldn’t afford pay child care own it’s hard to think practical perspective end see downside seems good use money mean there’s certainly room room improvementright mean it’s hugely popular sort one public goods that’s taken advantage social classes right like one things really like daughter’s upk really looks like new york city also don’t really understand idea discriminates stayathome parents mean part stayathome parents also use universal prek right mean stayathome parent still mind getting six hours day know it’s stay home parents end becoming class parents playing really influential role lot times schools run don’t know sort resent fact free public good gives hours every daywell those mean stayathome parents don’t obviously you’re stayathome parent wants avail universal prek it’s obviously good you’re using lot stayathome parents stayathome parents precisely don’t want daycare providers taking care kids six eight hours day parents performing large amounts mean large amounts unpaid labor effectively remains unpaid even tax dollars go pay somebody else taking care people’s kids it’s — — mean don’t think escape fact discriminates think best way proparent redistribution say we’re going universal daycare we’re also going provide subsidy people three kids two five they’re taking care home i’m curious much hostility would among liberals feminists groups lot voice kind universal prek arguments kind program right someone saying we’re going universal prek —i think depends whether make zero sum right like would hostile kind program meant away universal prek know wouldn’t hostile sort program top universal prek reasons pointed out think ends becoming incentive one parent stay home even like bonus families one parent privileged enough stay home would likely enough let parents avail private options prekright mean think agree michelle say reminds little bit argument society but “black lives matter” “all lives matter” it’s like greatest need greatest need absolutely lowincome workingincome families one cool things universal prek way de blasio rolled new york they’re trying address needs neediest families everyone think that’s great idea lot reasons one described michelle we’re helping integrate least prek racially earlier think that’s really important think that’s public good say would problem taxpayer dollars going incentivize reward folks every right stay home think way would work new york likely — know live brooklyn heights stayathome moms neighborhood afford stay home people anymore don’t love idea frankly taxpayer dollars going families don’t need massive needsso i’m favor universal prek mara understand idea don’t want money basically go uppermiddle class still think it’s real concern universal prek discriminates people want stayathome parents including workingclass peoplewe also established early conversation universal prek provides kind subsidy welloff moms brooklyn get stayathome moms put kids prek four five hours day sort ease stayathome lifestylesyou’re getting public good wealthier kids public school you’re getting they’re home would make argument dayyeah guess would argue it’s also public good give workingclass families choice want raise kids whether want stayathome parents daycare that’s choice uppermiddle class families havethere’s also sense better worse public consensus country kthrough education sort necessary part preparing people adulthood don’t kind consensus — think somewhat good reasons even quebec study suggests — yearolds need order prepared society right is say put yearolds public school think lot people would endorse said put yearolds daycare require people put kids school obvious homeschooling exceptions don’t require yearolds think obvious reasonsone interesting things new york there’s debate whether program rolled lowincome neighborhoods first i’m sure feel think goes heart we’re we’re discussing is discriminatory kinds families care don’t knowi don’t think it’s discriminatory think smart roll way created frankly kind politically powerful base support programs that’s kind general issue universal benefits versus meanstested benefits that know way got families like mine heavily invested success programthat’s right agree mean tend agree think it’s important middle class uppermiddle class wealthy families invested public school system new york city know unfortunately often done cost families doesn’t zerosum game great example something actually largely think workingone dynamic think uppermiddle class parents comfortable kids integrate poorer kids younger grades older gradesso think see lot sort acceptance idea racial socioeconomic integration among yearolds middle school rolls aroundwell look segregated city think integrated preschool darn good startlook little concerns it we’ve talked stayathome parent issue also think progressives often don’t pay enough attention quality aren’t willing tough enough shutting sanctioning programs good me overall prek ton good think it’s important thing keep mind moment it’s easy feel like everything moving wrong direction country actually things country getting betterwe’re going take quick break i’ll back conversation catholicism andrew sullivan it’s another hard winter scandal church roman catholic church pope francis recently convened church’s first global summit sex abuse promising accountability bishops well priests even taking dramatic step defrocking cardinal theodore mccarrick washington dc abusetheodore mccarrick lost title cardinal back july he’s become highest ranking figure defrocked recent memorymeanwhile new book homosexuality vatican stirred debate church’s rules celibacy prevalence closeted gay men priesthood andrew sullivan arguing shared church really ever since allowed guest blog many many years ago he’s writing new york magazine lately i’ve invited join intracatholic conversation andrew welcome “the argument”thank ross it’s lovely lovely talk again it’s longit indeed let’s start guess sort bigpicture practical question think caused church’s sex abuse scandal importantly still ongoing scandal many years revelations attempted solutions attempted summits onwell that’s big question think answer quite complicated many institutions child abuse problems mean it’s obviously roman catholic church mean we’ve seeing denominations find too start baseline depressing fact goes we’re becoming aware it also think way church closets gay priests way extremely high resistance giving scandal — formal word would church — culture secrecy hierarchy almost designed prevent things exposed quickly swiftly properly think problem fact priesthood overwhelming — well overwhelmingly disproportionately gay let’s put way led many priests closet celibacy is it’s process isn’t sudden reinvention human being it’s difficult task priests many occasionally fail priests something background could used them especially case gay priests would targeted violating celibacy instances might have also gay itself therefore emerged years really culture secrecy everyone something everybody else sort omertà — mutually assured destruction closet itself think helped cover sex abuse compound it way someone notice something untoward happening another priest wanted expose it person trying expose would easily able come back cases find something person get outed exact revenge kind allowed culture “don’t ask don’t tell” sex abuse children adolescents also sex general adults think contributed compounded years ways really horrifying even contemplatei think can’t understand without sort getting complexity right know think long time mean one things church especially since kind theological polarization wouldbe liberalizers wouldbe conservatives disagree church change much could change tend disagree specifically issues like celibacy church approaches homosexuality sides narratives where know liberals say well obviously it’s hierarchy celibacy authority conservatives tend say know well no sort breakdown church ‘ ‘ things went haywire lots men left priesthood sort sense rules relaxed people remained included lot people sort using priesthood could almost say sort hide society certain ways sort hide adult responsibility were kind people became predators kind people likely compromised various ways that’s got real spike sex abusewe don’t know we far back goes mean one looks religious institutions severe hierarchies isn’t really mechanism whistleblowing isn’t easily punished don’t think go overboard say never problem past discovered ‘ ‘ s clearly big spike seem think declined dramatically last decade so although agree it’s complicated thing think liberals conservatives something contribute understanding gone wrong would better able respect understand other’s concerns little better homosexual person really interest whatsoever defending sexual abuse kind gay straight question becomes though priesthood gay context church last years doubled impermissibility homosexual relationships indeed described homosexual terms don’t think would used describe group people sense going around talking many could really end rope ability keep lying time do morally psychologically destructive may leavewell let’s talk question priesthood say gay right think — think couple things going on think it’s sort combination deeplyrooted realities catholicism particular shift happened years ago right like know church teaches gay sex sinful celibate male priesthood obvious reasons large numbers samesex attracted catholic men would drawn priesthood seems like —right seems like sort unvarying fact catholic lifebut that’s bad reason though cover identity terrible reason become priest talked sort negative reason positive reasons gay men seek priesthood too — think it’s important say explicitly point discussion — vast majority gay priests wonderful people give lives amazing jobs day day blown away still blown away good work do solution honesty don’t wear sleeve every day shouldn’t talk much all okay parishioners understand journey person arethere’s sex abuse crisis relates pedophilia homosexuality pedophilia different gay men likely pedophiles straight men therefore don’t want say anything collapses two categories problem zone abuse former cardinal mccarrick abused seminarians falls into effect know could call sort samesex gay version metoo right it’s priests abusing children it’s closeted gay men hierarchy abusing position abuse seminarians young men teenagers rightwell think there’s confusion — there’s third category right completely consensual adult relationships sexually abusive mean abuse power within church plenty adjusted gay priests found balance that there’s sexual abuse totally different thing there’s sexual failure let’s say live celibacy there’s pedophilia three different things think they’re different also moral nature child abuse obviously absolutely despicable abuse also despicable don’t think it’s quite bad raping children problem church cannot even sanction healthy sexuality gay people church’s point view gets blurred togetherbut church’s view priests supposed healthy sexuality embodies sexual relationships question is think kind theological move catholic church make say look we’re going accept sexual revolution we’re going justify mix scriptural reinterpretation references darwinian biology historical revisionism end guess that’s question end end up church teaching sexuality end storywe healthy honest gay priests healthy honest straight priests committed far human beings celibacy different understanding homosexuality within church regarded problem solved gift cherished next generation see roman catholic church bastion irrational bigotry believe end change going disintegration churchok well leave
