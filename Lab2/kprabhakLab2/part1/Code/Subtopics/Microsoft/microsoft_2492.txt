elected us get decide sort new safeguards society seems like wrong way it think let — flawed may — democratically elected enforced institutions update rules world world changed lot tech changed world lot short time it’s going change much morefor example like newspaper page really wasn’t personalized version internet years ago one page everyone got — yahoo home page something like that idea internet could personalized friends huge breakthroughbut also came side effects content distributed friends internet that’s voted friends terms likes comments sometimes means — we’re human beings click things outrageous offensive sometimes — things negative actually spread faster things positiveand quickly saw media start change fit new distribution mechanism based friends sharing think look evolution social media people thinking sort ramifications lot what’s happened result new wave distributing content certainly think there’s lot opportunity sort coursecorrect herewe paused period time went deployment robotics process automation machine learning step back build ten commandments came back with think view humancentric set policiesand everything business every outcome owned human being one say algorithm machine it everything launched algorithmically robotically owned human being machine can’t control machine without process that’s involvedthese like children algorithms change jobs turn new person algorithm everything that’s put rewind button phd psychology makes sure red button press feel like manipulation happening way shape formso put structure process place make sure programmatically algorithmically machine doesn’t change fundamentals accountability within businessi look ai tool much like shovel kitchen knife comes ethics think there’s ethical ways use kitchen knife there’s unethical ways use kitchen knife they’ve around foreverwhat really ai think that’s people somewhat divided on think it’s something very simple first all talk ai talk machine learning don’t talk real intelligence machine learning innovation computerscomputers dumb make computers right thing past someone write elaborate kitchen recipe every possible step computer do computer would blindly follow rules innovation machine learning now instead giving computer rules give examplesand computer follows rules examples computer programming become easier result children program computers giving examples implications opinion groundbreaking societysenior vice president global affairs chief legal officer googlethe tech sector always lots different regulations privacy copyright safe harbors like we’re fans regulation it’s smart regulationand mean that so regulation starts really crisp definition what’s problem you’re trying solve narrowly tailored solve problem minimize blowback side effects third thoughtful analysis how second third implications rules might bewhen apply artificial intelligence think it’s likely start applications it’s rare regulate basic research there’s much risk deterring innovation could really incredibly productive along lines sebastian talking aboutbut get applications — whether it’s financial services health care agricultural productivity — already thoughtful series laws rules around that would natural expand issues raised aiso start national level say “what newage curriculum look like” started work career heartland america used
