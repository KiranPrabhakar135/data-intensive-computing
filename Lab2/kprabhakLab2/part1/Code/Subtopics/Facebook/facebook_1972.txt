radicalization youtubei think fact that know you’ve written about youtube started as remains open platform content voices opinions thoughts many being know really across entire spectrum many others may may agree with wouldn’t youtube working work on didn’t believe power diversity voices opinionshaving said that take notion dissemination harmful misinformation hatefilled content content cases
