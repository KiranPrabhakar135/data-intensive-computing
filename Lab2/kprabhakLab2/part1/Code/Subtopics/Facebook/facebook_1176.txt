fertilized egg later acquire unique genetic mutations new advances dna sequencing making possible pinpoint mutations — tell identical twins apartthis kind test could well determine brothers committed rape recently published study researchers concluded technique “a realistic option fit practical forensic casework”forensic dna testing arose s years first human genome sequenced scientists found

tried something thought impossible building test could tell twins apart researchers took advantage fact identical twins not fact genetically identicalwhen fertilized egg starts dividing there’s small chance new cell gain new mutation cells separate twin embryos one gets mutant cells gets rest unique mutations end cells throughout twin’s bodyin mid s scientists university hanover germany wondered
