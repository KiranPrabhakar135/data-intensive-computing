species among many superfamily contains tyrannosaurs includes two dozen dinosaurs date back million years t rex lived“it took evolution long time make t rex” said stephen brusatte paleontologist university edinburgh author recent book dinosaurs early tyrannosaurs small small chicken many dogsize deersize just last week smallish tyrannosaur north america reported earlier tyrannosaurs top predators million years“for time second even thirdtier predators” dr brusatte said “for history tyrannosaurs weren’t special” t rex emerged near end age dinosaurs becoming dominant predator north america rise t rex lesson evolution works dr brusatte said preordained plan millenniums many predatory dinosaurs appeared disappeared tyrannosaurs successful time evolved large dinosaurs like allosaurus hadn’t gone extinct might room top food chain creature like t rexit could said t rex lucked out then ruled time million years ago nonavian dinosaurs went extinctenvy always follows royalty dr brusatte said resentment t rex draws much attention many paleontologists “people study nondinosaurs say dinosaurs get attention” said “people study dinosaurs say theropods get attention people study theropods say oh tyrannosaurs get attention”and among tyrannosaurs one star king there’s reason t rex gets much attention james gorman science writer large host writer video series “sciencetake”
