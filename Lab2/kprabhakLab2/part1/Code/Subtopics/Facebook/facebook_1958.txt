rising threat wildlife electrocutionpower lines electrified fences killing birds monkeys pangolins even elephants surprising numbers south africa country ranches farms reserves national parks many surrounded miles electric fencing fencing keeps unwanted animal human intruders protects livestock desirable wildlifebut fencing also deadly unintended side effect frequently kills smaller animals particularly birds reptiles scientists eager conserve trip wires often blame positioned half foot ground wires meant send deterring zap hungry lions cropraiding bush pigs creatures respond turning tail tortoises hit tripwire withdraw shells rather retreat pangolins curl wire defensive ball animals stay put shocked hearts give out“farmers walk along fences find six eight dead tortoises space meters” said luke arnot veterinary surgeon lecturer university pretoria “with tortoises tend think poaching bush fires electric fences big bigger problem”according study  reptiles south africa killed year coming contact electric fences dr arnot trying sound alarm publishing articles farming ranching magazines detail practical inexpensive fixes devising wildlifefriendly guidelines electric fence installation remedies simple lifting trip wires higher ground example running current night predators around “these fences got capacity decimate whole populations they’re that” said threat posed wildlife “is still something lot people think about”south africa country struggling problem it’s fences kill power lines strung haphazardly across poor countries these too electrocute animals collisions alone often prove fatal birds “there studies world documented issue” said scott loss ecologist oklahoma state universityelectrocution affects diverse variety species some common jeopardizes survival species southern african countries electrocution considered leading threat endangered cape vultures critically endangered whitebacked vultures central asia electrocution kills estimated  endangered saker falcons year united states dr loss colleagues estimated tens millions birds killed power lines yearscientists aren’t yet sure great threat electrocution poses many affected species “birds conservation concern like redtailed hawks golden eagles dying electrocution don’t good handle mortality source contributing changes populations species all” dr loss saidmaking reliable estimates especially difficult wilder areas scavengers quickly sniff fallen carcasses said simon thomsett ornithologist trustee kenya bird prey trust “in wildlife areas kenya hyenas animals make paths power lines get dead birds” saidelectrocuted animals also necessarily killed spot birds may “get zapped” mr thomsett said fly hundreds miles away die week two later damaged limbs atrophy become necrotic“this makes impossible go underneath power lines enumerate number deaths” mr thomsett said “but think growing threat it’s enormously underestimated wildlife conservationists wardens conservancy managers”even large animals threatened endangered asian elephants killed electrocution state odisha india years mostly contact power lines giraffes african elephants leopards cape buffalo white rhinos electrocuted various countriesprimates especially frequent victims least species subspecies half threatened extinction affected electrocution asia africa latin america “this widespread

mortality injury cases reported colobus conservation nonprofit group based townin general primates electrocuted die instantly impact fall survive initial jolt may succumb later secondary infections “horrific injuries” caused shock ms katsis saidin addition conservation costs animals come contact power lines electric infrastructure extract significant economic toll  example vervet monkey caused nationwide blackout kenya tripping transformer cutting power  million homes businesses“animals caused outages disruptions damage infrastructure amounting billions dollars” said constant hoogstad senior manager industry partnerships endangered wildlife trust nonprofit conservation organization south africa “we estimate percent line faults interruptions south africa wildliferelated”mr hoogstad colleagues work directly eskom south africa’s stateowned electricity provider carry various mitigation strategies include making power lines visible birds insulating conductors pole tops designing poles birds cannot make contact live components“it’s really important engineer problem out” mr hoogstad saidthe results hit miss species ludwig’s bustard interventions reduce collisions power lines met little success others including blue cranes flamingoes mortalities reduced percent morewhy measures work species others “the milliondollar question” mr hoogstad said one research colleagues working answerthe endangered wildlife trust’s efforts replicated jordan namibia tanzania australia united states avian power line interaction committee nonprofit organization whose members include utility companies also works reduce bird deathsmost countries lack initiatives however many places problem set worsen mr thomsett warned kenya example power lines installed breakneck speed often protected areas along major pathways used migratory birds october mr thomsett’s colleagues found electrocuted remains threatened martial eagle — africa’s largest eagle — beneath newly constructed power lines near maasai mara national reserve bird juvenile one conservationists knew tagged seven months part longterm study species’ ecology survival kenya“the terrible thing power lines every
