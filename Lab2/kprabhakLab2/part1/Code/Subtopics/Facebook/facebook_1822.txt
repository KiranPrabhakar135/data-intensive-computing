scientists understood aggression deep pervasive part hummingbird life they too blind spots seemingly perfect match nectarbearing flowers slender nectarsipping beaks clearly showed hummingbirds shaped coevolution seemed clear that evolutionarily plants charge need reliable pollinators produced flowers shape demanded long slender bill hummingbird evolution obliged hummingbirds also heard call battle demanded different evolutionary course slender delicate beaks reshaped strong sharp dangerous weapons recent paper organizing summing years research alejandro ricoguevara colleagues university california berkeley shared evidence gathered highspeed video deadly beaks deployed maletomale conflict like horns bighorn sheep giant mandibles stag beetles hummingbird beaks used fight rivals mates sexual selection narrow part natural selection improvement mating chances dominant force males use bills stab males fence — feinting parrying sometimes knocking bird perch hummingbirds even hooked

hummingbirds fight including females species weaponized bills dr ricoguevara found males wage battles claim best mating territories species males assemble areas called leks away flowers feed on lek

— “just don’t let anybody else get flower”hummingbird research rich growing field delving everything aerodynamics birds process sucrose “in things measure animal like metabolism they’re extreme” said dr altshuler “another way they’re extreme terms specialization”hummingbirds also offer “opportunities explore limits physiology” dr ricoguevara said highest metabolic rate among vertebrates specialize hovering “the expensive form locomotion nature” hovering coincidentally form flight intense interest designers flying robots “everybody wants replicate hummingbird flight” saidthe birds also great use experiments said chris clark biologist university california riverside collaborated dr ricoguevara studies hummingbird flight birds fly readily feeders presence humans put off and “they fly really well wind tunnels cages”hummingbird behavior also interest shown excellent learners dr clark said speculation live edge terms energy budget may require great memory food sources arein listing multiple areas interest studying hummingbirds dr ricoguevara conceded he’s attracted another reason “what kept attached incredible personality” said “they bold come explore doing inquisitive” hope science “my
