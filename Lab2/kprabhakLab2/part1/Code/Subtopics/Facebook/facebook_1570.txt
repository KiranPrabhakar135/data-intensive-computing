dietary changes bring us ‘f’ words study tackles complexities language’s originssofter foods agricultural lifestyles may changed human bite making easier form certain sounds thousands years ago ancestors left behind huntergatherer lifestyle started settle down grew vegetables grains stews porridge kept cows milk turned cheese shaped clay storage pots done things would speak languages make sounds hear today probably not suggests study published thursday science“certain sounds like ‘f’ sounds recent say fairly good confidence   years ago sounds simply didn’t exist” said balthasar bickel linguist university zurich author new researchthe study concluded transition eating softer foods changed bites developed people aged physical changes authors said made slightly easier farmers make certain sounds like “f” “v” various processes study directly address sounds made way half languages used today study’s authors called greater consideration biological factors studying development human language like science times page facebook  sign science times newslettera number linguists agreed findings plausible others said study’s broader conclusions agriculture’s effect language may overstated cautioned interpretations may unwittingly restate discredited ethnocentric racist views past tarred study linguisticsdr bickel colleagues revisited question origins language diverse sounds hear today acquired recently linguists think language abilities universal haven’t really changed course human history new study suggested past thousand years agriculture fostered arrival new sounds human voicesin  linguist named charles hockett observed “f” “v” sounds appeared less frequently absent languages huntergatherers proposed dietary changes promoted spread agriculture may transformed teeth jaws making easier people produce sounds difficult articulate others many criticized dr hockett’s idea ultimately abandoned — even linguists began favoring brain’s role guiding language social physical influences time since however researchers learned gradual processes diet may shape human bite connection sounds make remained unclearin new study researchers pored thousands languages computer simulations differently shaped mouths techniques gathered paleoanthropology linguistics speech science evolutionary biology scientists found eating softer foods associated agriculture changed adult bitesfor living huntergatherer diet overbites jaws teeth youth often replaced adulthood called edgetoedge bites front teeth sit atop one another softer diet overbites may persist adulthood overbite pronouncing sounds called labiodentals require moving bottom lip top teeth — think words “fava” “fever” — percent easier thousands years sounds could made way languagethis scenario probable not researchers said although concede may occur universally “some languages develop labiodentals” said steven moran linguist university zurich “some languages don’t”the findings challenge idea sounds make related human evolution shaped brains subject paper doesn’t dwell on hominin ancestors may cooked food example made softer contributed changes shape skull mandible made way complex brain long agriculture influenced diet said jordi marcénogué studies jaw evolution primates university hamburg germany“what came first” asked “the changes speech changes brain”ray jackendoff linguist tufts university involved study said group’s finding ease saying sounds may vary diet “is interesting earthshaking” different cultures may uttered certain sounds often others “doesn’t say much deep history language”other cultural social factors like adopting sounds neighbors also may contributed changes language study’s authors said example huntergatherer groups agrarian groups mixed sounds others point labiodental sounds even found among huntergatherers edgetoedge bites like yanomami people south america live mostly isolated huntergatherers fishers horticulturistsother linguists also point study rests untested assumptions like much small bite changes might influence sounds types errors could produce age huntergathers’ teeth wear down notion agriculture useful proxy diet role cognitive factors including neural control speech organs also goes unaddressedthe authors respond minimizing roles played culture society cognition development language say physical differences people deserve much attention study human language development research communication systems animalssome linguists worry handled extreme care subsequent studies physical biological differences language could invigorate ethnocentric beliefs plagued linguistics past especially research publicly interpreted making value judgments different groups’ languages“the risk bias focus positive benefits gained individuals agrarian societies rather also considering whatever benefits individuals huntergatherer societies might have” said adam albright linguist mitdr albright said current study considered questions hopes future inquiries area also investigate sounds might left behind shift agriculturedr bickel agreed “it interesting investigate sounds might gone lost transition softer diets”
