making new drugs dose artificial intelligencesan francisco — think world cup biochemical researchevery two years hundreds scientists enter global competition tackling biological puzzle call “the protein folding problem” try predict threedimensional shape proteins human body one knows solve problem even winners chip away it solution could streamline way scientists create new medicines fight diseasemohammed alquraishi biologist dedicated career kind research flew early december cancun mexico academics gathering discuss results latest contest checked hotel fivestar resort caribbean consumed melancholythe contest critical assessment structure prediction academics deepmind artificial intelligence lab owned google’s parent company“i surprised deflated” said dr alquraishi researcher harvard medical school “they way front everyone else”deepmind specializes “deep learning” type artificial intelligence rapidly changing drug discovery science growing number companies applying similar methods parts long enormously complex process produces new medicines ai techniques speed many aspects drug discovery and cases perform tasks typically handled scientists“it machines going replace chemists” said derek lowe longtime drug discovery researcher author pipeline widely read blog dedicated drug discovery “it’s chemists use machines replace don’t”after conference cancun dr alquraishi described experience blog post melancholy felt losing deepmind gave way called “a rational assessment value scientific progress”but strongly criticized big pharmaceutical companies like merck novartis well academic community keeping pace“the smartest ambitious researchers wanting work protein structure look deepmind opportunities instead merck novartis” wrote “this fact send chills spines pharma executives won’t they’re clueless rudderless asleep helm”the big pharma companies see situation differently though merck exploring protein folding researchers believe potential impact would years away applying deep learning aspects drug discovery process“we connect many dots” said juan alvarez associate vice president computational structural chemistry merckin spring  making headlines ai systems played complex games like ancient board game go deepmind researchers looking new challenges held “hackathon” company headquarters londonworking two computer scientists deepmind researcher rich evans homed protein folding found game simulated scientific task built system learned play game own results promising enough deepmind greenlight fulltime research projectthe protein folding problem asks straightforward question predict physical structure protein — shape three dimensionsif scientists predict protein’s shape better determine molecules “bind” — attach it physically — one way drugs developed drug binds particular proteins body changes behaviorin latest contest deepmind made predictions using “neural networks” complex mathematical systems learn tasks analyzing vast amounts data analyzing thousands proteins neural network learn predict shape othersthis deep learning technology recognizes faces photos post facebook past decade technology reinvented wide range internet services consumer products robotic devices areas scientific researchmany academics competed used methods similar deepmind doing deepmind competition sizable margin — improved prediction accuracy nearly twice much experts expected contest winnerdeepmind’s victory showed future biochemical research increasingly driven machines people oversee machinesthis kind ai research benefits enormous amounts computing power deepmind lean massive computer data centers underpin google lab also employs many world’s top ai researchers know get hardware“it allows us much creative try many ideas often parallel” said demis hassabis chief executive cofounder deepmind google acquired reported  million universities big pharmaceutical companies unlikely match resources thanks cloud computing services offered google tech giants price computing power continues drop dr alquraishi urged lifesciences community shift attention toward kind ai work practiced deepmindsome researchers already moving direction many startups like atomwise san francisco recursion salt lake city using artificial intelligence techniques accelerate aspects drug discovery recursion instance uses neural networks methods analyze images cells learn new drugs affect cellsthe big pharma companies also beginning explore methods sometimes partnership startups“everyone trending area” said jeremy jenkins head data science chemical biology therapeutics novartis “it like turning big ship think methods eventually scale size entire company”mr hassabis said deepmind committed solving protein folding problem many experts said even solved work needed doctors patients benefited practical way“this first step” said david baker director institute protein design university washington “there many steps still go”as work better understand proteins body instance scientists must also create new proteins serve drug candidates dr baker believes creating proteins important drug discovery “folding” methods explored task said well suited deepmindstyle aideepmind researchers focus games contests show clear improvement artificial intelligence clear approach translates many tasks“because complexity drug discovery need wide variety tools” dr alvarez said “there onesizefitsall answer”
