connected river channels“it basically agitates water like washing machine” said phillip l manning paleontologist university manchester england one authors paper “when shock wave dissipates almost

contained embryo remains “suggested dinosaurs major reptiles probably staggering extinction fateful day”in interview steve brusatte vertebrate paleontologist evolutionary biologist university edinburgh called new yorker portrayal fossil find “a remarkable story” wanted believe “but it’s disappointing dinosaurs mentioned peerreviewed paper” said “and they’re not simply isn’t evidence
