want years we’ve told victims violence want nothing people hurt locked treated harshly true survivors want revenge retribution especially immediate aftermath crime ms sered emphatic rage pathological desire revenge blameworthy normal important healing process much denial anger normal stages griefbut also stresses number people interested revenge punishment greatly exaggerated all survivors almost never offered real choices usually ask victims “do want incarceration” we’re really asking “do want something nothing” us hurt families communities hurting want something rather nothing many oppressed communities drug treatment good schools economic investment job training trauma grief support available options restorative justice option thing offer prisons prosecutors policebut happens ms sered wondered instead asking “do want something nothing” started asking “do want intervention prison” turns out given real choice survivors choose prison preferred responsethis survivors group especially merciful contrary they’re pragmatic know criminal justice system almost certainly fail deliver want need overcome pain trauma percent cases end plea bargains negotiated lawyers behind scenes given system’s design survivors know system cannot trusted validate suffering give answers even meaningful opportunity heard trusted keep others safein fact many victims find incarceration actually makes feel less safe worry others angry reporting crime retaliate fear happen person eventually returns home many believe good reason incarceration likely make person worse better — frightening prospect they’re likely encounter person they’re back neighborhoodas one woman whose yearold son badly beaten robbed explained ms sered “when first found this wanted young man drown death wanted burn death
