read mark zuckerberg’s blog post ‘privacyfocused vision’ facebookmr zuckerberg detailed plans integrate instagram whatsapp messenger people communicate privately directly across networks shift follows years scandal facebook criticized handling user data spread disinformation focus last couple years understanding addressing biggest challenges facing facebook means taking positions important issues concerning future internet note i’ll outline vision principles around building privacyfocused messaging social networking platform there’s lot here we’re committed working openly consulting experts across society develop thisover last years facebook instagram helped people connect friends communities interests digital equivalent town square people increasingly also want connect privately digital equivalent living room think future internet believe privacyfocused communications platform become even important today’s open platforms privacy gives people freedom connect naturally build social networkstoday already see private messaging ephemeral stories small groups far fastest growing areas online communication number reasons this many people prefer intimacy communicating oneonone friends people cautious permanent record they’ve shared expect able things like payments privately securelypublic social networks continue important people’s lives — connecting everyone know discovering new people ideas content giving people voice broadly people find valuable every day still lot useful services build top them now ways people also want interact privately there’s also opportunity build simpler platform that’s focused privacy firsti understand many people don’t think facebook would even want build kind privacyfocused platform — frankly don’t currently strong reputation building privacy protective services we’ve historically focused tools open sharing we’ve repeatedly shown evolve build services people really want including private messaging storiesi believe future communication increasingly shift private encrypted services people confident say stays secure messages content won’t stick around forever future hope help bring aboutwe plan build way we’ve developed whatsapp focus fundamental private use case — messaging — make secure possible build ways people interact top that including calls video chats groups stories businesses payments commerce ultimately platform many kinds private servicesthis privacyfocused platform built around several principlesprivate interactions people simple intimate places clear control communicate confidence one else access shareencryption people’s private communications secure endtoend encryption prevents anyone — including us — seeing people share servicesreducing permanence people comfortable themselves worry share coming back hurt later won’t keep messages stories around longer necessary deliver service longer people want themsafety people expect everything keep safe services within limits what’s possible encrypted serviceinteroperability people able use apps reach friends able communicate across networks easily securelysecure data storage people expect won’t store sensitive data countries weak records human rights like privacy freedom expression order protect data improperly accessedover next years plan rebuild services around ideas decisions we’ll face along way mean taking positions important issues concerning future internet understand lot tradeoffs get right we’re committed consulting experts discussing best way forward take time we’re going develop major change direction behind closed doors we’re going openly collaboratively many issues affect different parts societyfor service feel private must never doubt communicating with we’ve worked hard build privacy products including public sharing one great property messaging services even contacts list grows individual threads groups remain private friends evolve time messaging services evolve gracefully remain intimatethis different broader social networks people accumulate friends followers services feel public wellsuited many important uses — telling friends something using voice important topics finding communities people similar interests following creators media buying selling things organizing fundraisers growing businesses many things benefit everyone know one place still see experiences together feels like town square intimate space like living roomthere opportunity build platform focuses ways people want interact privately sense privacy intimacy technical features — designed deeply feel service overall whatsapp example team obsessed creating intimate environment every aspect product even we’ve built features allow broader sharing it’s still less public experience team built groups put size limit make sure every interaction felt private shipped stories whatsapp limited public content worried might erode feeling privacy see lots public content — even didn’t actually change you’re sharing within years expect future versions messenger whatsapp become main ways people communicate facebook network we’re focused making apps faster simpler private secure including endtoend encryption plan add ways interact privately friends groups businesses evolution successful interacting friends family across facebook network become fundamentally private experiencepeople expect private communications secure seen people they’ve sent — hackers criminals overreaching governments even people operating services they’re usingthere growing awareness entities access data vulnerabilities someone misuse cyber attack expose it also growing concern among technology may centralizing power hands governments companies like ours people worry services could access messages use advertising ways don’t expectendtoend encryption important tool developing privacyfocused social network encryption decentralizing — limits services like seeing content flowing makes much harder anyone else access information encryption increasingly important part online lives banking healthcare services it’s also built endtoend encryption whatsapp acquired itin last year i’ve spoken dissidents who’ve told encryption reason free even alive governments often make unlawful demands data push back fight requests court there’s always risk we’ll lose case — information isn’t encrypted we’d either turn data risk employees arrested failed comply may seem extreme we’ve case one employees actually jailed providing access someone’s private information even though couldn’t access since encryptedat time real safety concerns address implement endtoend encryption across messaging services encryption powerful tool privacy includes privacy people bad things billions people use service connect going misuse truly terrible things like child exploitation terrorism extortion responsibility work law enforcement help prevent wherever can working improve ability identify stop bad actors across apps detecting patterns activity means even can’t see content messages continue invest work face inherent tradeoff never find potential harm today security systems see messages themselvesfinding right ways protect privacy safety something societies historically grappled with still many open questions we’ll consult safety experts law enforcement governments best ways implement safety measures we’ll also need work together platforms make sure industry get right create common approach betteron balance believe working towards implementing endtoend encryption private communications right thing do messages calls sensitive private conversations people have world increasing cyber security threats heavyhanded government intervention many countries people want us take extra step secure private data seems right me long take time build appropriate safety systems stop bad actors much possibly within limits encrypted service we’ve started working safety systems building work we’ve done whatsapp we’ll discuss experts beyond fully implementing endtoend encryption learn experts we’ll finalize roll systemswe increasingly believe it’s important keep information around shorter periods time people want know share won’t come back hurt later reducing length time information stored accessible helpone challenge building social tools “permanence problem” build large collections messages photos time become liability well asset example many people facebook long time photos younger could embarrassing people also really love keeping record lives posts facebook instagram disappeared people would lose access lot valuable knowledge experiences others sharedi believe there’s opportunity set new standard private communication platforms — content automatically expires archived time stories already expire hours unless archive them gives people comfort share naturally philosophy could extended private contentfor example messages could deleted month year default would reduce risk messages resurfacing embarrassing later course you’d ability change timeframe turn autodeletion threads wanted could also provide option set individual messages expire seconds minutes wantedit also makes sense limit amount time store messaging metadata use data run spam safety systems don’t always need keep around long time important part solution collect less personal data first place way whatsapp built outsetpeople want able choose service use communicate people however today want message people facebook use messenger instagram use direct whatsapp use whatsapp want give people choice reach friends across networks whichever app preferwe plan start making possible send messages contacts using services extend interoperability sms too course would optin able keep accounts separate you’d likethere privacy security advantages interoperability example many people use messenger android send receive sms texts texts can’t endtoend encrypted sms protocol encrypted ability message across services however you’d able send encrypted message someone’s phone number whatsapp messengerthis could also improve convenience many experiences people use facebook instagram social network whatsapp preferred messaging service example lots people selling items marketplace list phone number people message buying it that’s ideal you’re giving strangers phone number interoperability you’d able use whatsapp receive messages sent facebook account without sharing phone number — buyer wouldn’t worry whether prefer messaged one network otheryou imagine many simple experiences like — person discovers business instagram easily transitions preferred messaging app secure payments customer support another person wants catch friend send message goes preferred app without think person prefers reached simply post story day across facebook instagram get replies friends one placeyou already send receive sms texts messenger android today we’d like extend future perhaps including new telecom rcs standard however several issues we’ll need work possible first apple doesn’t allow apps interoperate sms devices we’d able android second we’d need make sure interoperability doesn’t compromise expectation encryption people already using whatsapp finally would create safety spam vulnerabilities encrypted system let people send messages unknown apps safety security systems couldn’t see patterns activitythese significant challenges many questions require consultation discussion implement this give people choice use preferred service securely reach people wantpeople want know data stored securely places trust looking future internet privacy believe one important decisions we’ll make we’ll build data centers store people’s sensitive datathere’s important difference providing service country storing people’s data there build infrastructure around world we’ve chosen build data centers countries track record violating human rights like privacy freedom expression build data centers store sensitive data countries rather caching nonsensitive data could make easier governments take people’s informationupholding principle may mean services get blocked countries won’t able enter others anytime soon that’s tradeoff we’re willing make believe storing people’s data countries secure enough foundation build important internet infrastructure onof course best way protect sensitive data store all whatsapp doesn’t store encryption keys plan services going forwardbut storing data countries also establishes precedent emboldens governments seek greater access citizen’s data therefore weakens privacy security protections people around world think it’s important future internet privacy industry continues hold firm storing people’s data places won’t secureover next year beyond lot details tradeoffs work related principles lot work early stages committed consulting experts advocates industry partners governments — including law enforcement regulators — around world get decisions rightat time working principles first step building privacyfocused social platform beyond that significant thought needs go services build top foundation — people payments financial transactions role businesses advertising offer platform private servicesbut initial questions critical get right well create platforms private sharing could even important people platforms we’ve already built help people share connect openlydoing means taking positions important issues facing future internet society opportunity set stand decide value private communications gets decide long data storedi believe working towards world people speak privately live freely knowing information seen want see won’t stick around forever help move world direction proud difference we’ve made
