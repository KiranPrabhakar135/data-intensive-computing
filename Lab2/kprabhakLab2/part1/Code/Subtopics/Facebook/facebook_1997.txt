whales serenaders seas it’s quite racketwhy whales sing scientists still aren’t certain maybe whales aren’t either that’s one things researchers learned recently eavesdropping whales several parts world listening changes pattern pitch together new studies suggest whales whistling water constantly evolving form communication beginning understandmost whales dolphins vocalize dolphins toothed whales mostly make clicking whistling sounds humpbacks possibly bowheads sing complex songs repeated patterns said michael noad associate professor cetacean ecology acoustics laboratory university queensland australia birds may broadcast social hierarchy among songsharing populations allowing dominant bird pick playlist patterns whales pass song fragments across hundreds miles thousands animals far mysterious “the thing always gets bed morning function song” dr noad said “i find humpback song fascinating point view it’s evolved”the leading hypothesis male humpbacks — males sing — trying attract females may also switch tunes another male nearby apparently assess rival’s size fitness said dr noad senior author one four new papers whale songswhy humpbacks’ musical patterns tend complex whales also bit murky dr noad suggested development may result socalled “runaway selection” early humpbacks complex songs much successful mating gained substantial evolutionary advantage brethren simpler vocalizations led large sometimes noisy animalsjulien bonnel associate scientist woods hole oceanographic institution massachusetts said growing research also shows importance collecting data many years offering insights whales ocean conditions affect species technology recording whales gotten much cheaper last dozen years so making accessible researchers computer programs analyze huge data sets quickly helped interpret years recordings tagging whales without hurting produced data dr noad noted tags remain whale hours limiting information collectedin one new studies led scientists new yorkbased wildlife conservation society researchers tracked humpbacks singing along east west coasts africa comparing songs sung coast gabon near madagascarthe study published journal royal society open science confirmed two populations interact noting overlap vocalizations researchers recorded songs annually using handheld hydrophones aboard boats“male humpback whales within population tend sing song type it’s continuously changing evolving time” said melinda rekdahl study’s first author marine conservation scientist wildlife society “it’s thought one best examples cultural evolution animal kingdom”dr rekdahl wasn’t boat collected sound new study knows firsthand “it amazing experience” said sound nearby singer resonates hull boat “if singer close hear song getting fainter whale surfaces nearby” recalled“if singers aren’t close” added “you often sit hours recording hearing song headphones see whale anywhere” dr rekdahl based new study data collected  thought recordings offered best opportunity compare song similarities neighboring populations idea using songs look population mixing connectivity relatively new said proven valuable last yearssome animals repeat sounds others sing “aberrant” tunes juveniles may hum jingles altogether different adults’ humpbacks also alter tunes time one reason might novelty — nearby females “if swimming  whales males singing song would drive crazy” dr rekdahl said maybe “females just like give new song”two additional recent studies examined songs change seasonally across yearsin one paper jenny allen doctoral student dr noad found unexpected pattern among humpbacks songs reach certain level complexity humpbacks drop tune entirely pick new simpler one study first quantify complexity songs published proceedings royal society b biological sciences “that clear oscillating pattern something didn’t really expect” said dr allen postdoctoral researcher university queensland lecturer griffith university australiaassuming songs meant attract females “it might brandnew song bit sexier continuing sing complicated version old song” said it’s hard memorize whole new song “they’re simplifying make easy learn much new material once”humpback songs lot repeating patterns might make easier remember rhymes end poetry lines aid memorization dr allen said also found lot predictability patterns compared pop songs based four chordsin another new paper researchers university brest france found pitch antarctic blue whale pygmy blue whale fin whale vocalizations fell various recording sites southern indian ocean whale’s anatomy louder call higher pitch quieter one lower essentially whales gotten slightly quieter said emmanuelle leroy research fellow university new south wales author new research“blue whales mostly solitary communicate across large distance need produce really lowfrequency highintensity calls” said “the calls really loud propagate hundreds kilometers”her team two hypotheses explain drop pitch across years populations rebounding since end commercial whaling perhaps whales don’t need calls carry far heard others like science times page facebook  sign science times newsletteror perhaps oceans acidifying climate change calls naturally carrying farther allowing whales reduce volume team believe change pitch tied directly human activitytheir research published journal geophysical research oceans also showed call pitch antarctic blue whales varies across seasons pitches increasing  hertz spring summer dropping times might whales’ response loud cleaving icebergs spring summer extremely loud sounds — like cracking ice glass — make harder whales hear one another crank volume dr leroy saiddr noad thinks overall drop pitch could reflection aging population older whales making deeper sounds contrary scientists also believes whales hear humanmade noises quite distance way people urban environments hear distant rumble traffic even cars passing directly byhumpback whales made “really nice comeback” since commercial whaling largely stopped s dr noad said unknown reasons blue fin whales still struggling thousand antarctic blue whales remainin yet another new study related whale song researchers woods hole found shortfinned pilot whales living coast hawaii vocal dialects suggesting different groups purposely avoiding one another relatively little known species’ behavior new research provides better sense social ties whale groups could promote understanding genetic diversity evolution well conservation researchers said
