field ran check early  discovered model reality alignment“we noticed error arctic increasing faster would expect” said arnaud chulliat geophysicist university colorado boulder noaaalthough north magnetic pole long scurrying away canada toward siberia rate moves drastically changes throughout th century drifted roughly miles per year s magnetic north picked speed year traveling miles per year way canada then  pole actually slowed miles per year team issued recent magnetic map scientists predicted speed would continue dropping — didn’t model released north magnetic pole picked momentum again fluctuating around miles per year late  pole crossed international date line eastern hemisphere“it’s fact pole moving problem it’s fact it’s accelerating rate” said william brown geophysicist british geological survey “the acceleration deceleration is harder predict thing going be”and means model currently incorrect — least arcticwhile many us might spend much time — time — top world

said ciaran beggan geophysicist bgswith updates complete scientists anxious understand causes pole’s siberian sprint “it’s clear something strange happening” said phil livermore geophysicist university leeds englandon multiple occasions earth’s long history magnetic field weakened dramatically north magnetic pole slipped toward bottom planet south magnetic sauntered toward top process took thousand years time field’s full strength returns flippedthe pole’s recent journey along changes — like weakening earth’s magnetic field — led scientists wonder whether reversal might around corner geologically speaking“it tick boxes magnetic reversal” said courtney sprain geophysicist university liverpool england added that “we definitely can’t say sure”most scientists including dr sprain doubt impending geomagnetic reversal first north magnetic pole appear move doesn’t represent global phenomenon regional onedr livermore example thinks two large magnetic structures planet’s outer core one beneath canada one beneath siberia interact together emit magnetic pole canadian patch weakening means it’s essentially losing tugofwar causing north magnetic pole turn toward siberia time south magnetic pole standing relatively stillsecond earth’s magnetic field weakening many experts argue it’s still longterm geologic averagepeter olson geophysicist johns hopkins university thinks current changes represent transient fluctuation reversal“it’s analogy stock market correction worldwide depression” said “how know stock market today heading toward worldwide depression crash well could be much likely it’s correction rebound”even magnetic field edge flip scientists argue it’s apocalyptic scenario although field provides essential protection sun’s powerful radiation fossil records reveal mass extinctions past reversals whatever risks power grids communications humanity would ample time prepare“of problems have top problem” said dr olsona map earlier version article
