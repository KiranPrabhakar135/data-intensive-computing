tarantula became scientific celebrity poached wildcontroversy new spider species resurrected thorny ethical questions scientists specimens february journal british tarantula society published paper describing new species tarantula discovered national park sarawak malaysia male species unremarkable brown female eyecatching electric blue legs new spiders discovered time paper likely would gone largely unnoticed — article science magazine appeared soon afterward article claimed tarantula researchers received specimens secondhand private collectors poland britain poached malaysianeither ray gabriel danniella sherwood authors study responded email requests comment peter kirk chairman british tarantula society editor society’s journal said collectors shown scientists import permit poland “had reason think due process wasn’t followed”“the paper absolutely retracted it’s completely legitimate published paper” saidthe incident reignited decadesold debate among scientists hobbyists alike research ethics specimen collection “biopiracy” — use natural resources without obtaining permission local communities sharing benefits them“the majority responses i’ve seen people saying ‘yes need stop this’ there’s also fair amount people basically trying justify poaching smuggling tarantulas” said ernest cooper conservation consultant british columbia “it’s strange slightly colonial attitude of ‘we know better developing countries laws don’t matter’”illegal wildlife trade dominated headlines criminal cartels trafficking ivory rhino horn pangolin scales scientists also complicit illegal trade poaching specimens working do type wildlife crime occurs much smaller scale experts variety fields believe significant issue“it’s problem globally happens lot” said sérgio henriques chairman spider scorpion group international union conservation nature “i know fact researchers linked academia purchased collected specimens nonlegal way”for mr henriques others sort collection raises deep ethical concerns “we’re scientists ones supposed know better leading example” said “if can’t follow rules demanding others do”the problem likely intensify conservationists believe “scientists collect illegally normally huge problem scientists study cacti example small community” said pablo guerrero botanist university concepción chile “but every year scientists working around globe every year species becoming endangered”other experts argue scientific misconduct sort barely registers among tremendous threats facing wildlife today “the fact people make big thing tarantula whatever else instead making case need protect animal lives one does” said heiko bleher independent freshwater fish expert researched collected specimens countriesno one knows prevalent illegal collecting use poached specimens among scientists covert nature trade also difficult define counts scientist counts breaking lawexpertlevel hobbyists often publish scientific literature example employed university research institute subject strict codes conduct may prone cut corners mr cooper said paper mr gabriel ms sherwood said affiliated oxford university museum natural history paul smith director museum said neither employees mr gabriel honorary associate ms sherwood volunteer“the research carried independently connected museum way” dr smith said paper would failed pass museum’s ethics review requires authors provide proof legality specimens addedthe ethics surrounding scientific acquisitions hazy still cases clearly criminal  example curator charles university botanical garden prague convicted south africa collecting  protected plants cuttings seeds western cape according case records earl thomas schultz former curator herpetology san diego zoo pleaded guilty fraud theft caught trafficking imperiled reptiles “sometimes seemed like specialized targeting scientists felt wildlife conservation laws” said ken mccloud retired fish wildlife service special agent investigated latter casein instances though “there extensive gray areas it’s much matter ethics legality” said peter paul van dijk conservation biologist global wildlife conservation nonprofit group austin texfor example many museum specimens — especially ones collected decades ago — murky origins “there’s still idea ends justify means terms describing specimens” said lisa buckley paleontologist peace region paleontology research center british columbia “that’s attitude really needs die flaming death”other scientists compunction “we different ethical standards mine rock bottom” said david martill paleontologist university portsmouth britainin  dr martill made headlines stumbling across millionyearold brazilian fossil german museum realizing constituted world’s first known fourlegged snake shortly news broke brazilian authorities began investigation citing laws enacted forbidding export fossils country dr martill stands decision publish “this really interesting fascinating fossil think world know it” said living animals another matter altogether “there organisms rare threatened sometimes radical protection measures needed” protections differ country country scientists often get bogged confusing bureaucracy lengthy waits countries go far forbid export entirely especially newly discovered species “brazil imposed regulations simply insane” mr bleher said “they require deposit materials wherever tell you specimens sitting years institutions brazil one working them”researchers long complained brazil’s regulations — originally set ensure country receives adequate recognition compensation pharmaceutical discoveries — impede sciencewhile researchers simply give up others travel tourist visas undertake collections without permit “most fieldworking entomologists experience this” said petr svacha entomologist academy sciences czech republic “believe me frustrating useful work hiding like criminal”in  dr svacha friend spent month prison india accused collecting insects without permit singalila national park  scientists including many india protested arrest arguing draconian application law end dr svacha paid fine friend sentenced three years prison fled country appealwildlife laws generally designed vertebrates mind unlike tigers elephants insects composed huge populations affected even heavy collection dr svacha said “when applied insects prohibitive conservation rules designed protect individual animals become nonsensical help anything” said “under circumstance everything possible circumvent rules feel guilty”dr svacha added that like entomologists knows also readily works specimens obtains hobbyists commercial sellers whether specimens collected legally something asks about said “because absolutely unimportant”like science times page facebook  sign science times newsletterthis posture researchers fields well study fossils smuggled china reptiles trafficked indonesia ethics working specimens quickly become blurred dr van dijk put it “if need little blood sample go friendly hobbyist road take drops blood captive animal would really go due diligence making sure animal properly collected”in future mr kirk said journal british tarantula society require authors provide copy permits manuscript deals specimens another country many publications do society also prohibit sale new blue tarantula annual exhibition said the species already advertised online europe united states much  eachmr henriques would like see creation website managed trustworthy global organization country outlines legislation application process specimen collection export site could serve repository previously issued permits said allowing researchers museums governments journals verify given permit specimen“i personally think it’s good blue tarantula case got attention did ignited interest topic” mr henriques said “we need try keep conversation going use chance find solutions”
