people fall fake newsare blinded political passions intellectually lazywhat makes people susceptible fake news forms strategic misinformation what anything done itthese questions become urgent recent years least revelations russian campaign influence united states presidential election disseminating propaganda social media platforms general political culture seems increasingly populated people espouse outlandish demonstrably false claims often align political ideologythe good news psychologists social scientists working hard understand prevents people seeing propaganda bad news yet consensus answer much debate among researchers falls two opposing camps one group claims ability reason hijacked partisan convictions is we’re prone rationalization group — two us belong — claims problem often fail exercise critical faculties is we’re mentally lazyhowever recent research suggests silver lining dispute camps appear capturing aspect problem understand much problem result rationalization much result laziness learn factor plays role types situations we’ll better able design policy solutions help combat problemthe rationalization camp gained considerable prominence recent years built around set theories contending comes politically charged issues people use intellectual abilities persuade believe want true rather attempting actually discover truth according view political passions essentially make people unreasonable even — indeed especially — tend good reasoning contexts roughly smarter are better rationalizingsome striking evidence used support position comes influential study law professor dan kahan colleagues found degree political polarization issue climate change greater among people scored higher measures science literary numerical ability among scored lower tests apparently “analytical” democrats better able convince climate change problem “analytical” republicans better able convince climate change problem professor kahan found similar results in example studies gun control experimentally manipulated partisan slant information participants asked assessthe implications profound reasoning exacerbate problem provide solution comes

corrections fail reduce misperceptions also sometimes increased them seemed people ideologically inclined believe given falsehood worked hard come reasons correction wrong came believe falsehood even stronglybut “rationalization” account though compelling contexts strike us natural common explanation human weakness misinformation believe people often don’t think critically enough information encountera great deal research cognitive psychology shown little bit reasoning goes long way toward forming accurate beliefs example people think analytically those likely exercise analytic skills trust “gut” response less superstitious less likely believe conspiracy theories less receptive seemingly profound actually empty assertions like “wholeness quiets infinite phenomena” body evidence suggests main factor explaining acceptance fake news could cognitive laziness especially context social media news items often skimmed merely glanced atto test possibility recently ran set studies participants various political persuasions indicated whether believed series news stories showed real headlines taken social media true false gauged whether participants would engage reasoning “go gut” complete something called cognitive reflection test test widely used psychology behavioral economics consists questions intuitively compelling incorrect answers easily shown wrong modicum reasoning for example “if you’re running race pass person second place place in” you’re thinking might say “first place” course answer second placewe found people engaged reflective reasoning better telling true false regardless whether headlines aligned political views we controlled demographic facts level education well political leaning followup studies yet published shown finding replicated using pool participants nationally representative respect age gender ethnicity region residence applies ability discern true claims false ones also ability identify excessively partisan coverage true eventsour results strongly suggest somehow cultivating promoting reasoning abilities part solution kinds partisan misinformation circulate social media new research provides evidence even highly political contexts people irrational rationalization camp contends recent studies shown instance correcting partisan misperceptions backfire time — contrary results professors nyhan reifler described — instead leads accurate beliefswe arguing findings professor kahan’s support rationalization theory unreliable argument cases reasoning goes awry — surprising attentiongrabbing — seem exceptions rather rule reason always even typically held captive partisan biases many perhaps cases seems reason promote formation accurate beliefsthis academic debate real implications public policy research suggests solution politically charged misinformation involve devoting resources spread accurate information training encouraging people think critically aren’t doomed unreasonable even highly
