mosquitoes program held meetings events explain project ask households participate thousands households got mozzie box special bucket eggs mosquito food raise release good mosquitoes elementary schoolchildren got mozzie boxes — magnifying glass booklet — part citywide science projectimported cases dengue kept rising townsville mosquito releases local transmission dengue virtually stopped four people caught dengue without traveled abroad compared equivalent period program one four lived area good mosquitoes taken over person highly mobile could well become infected different neighborhoodwhat’s good mosquito it’s one infected bacteria called wolbachia it’s harmless humans vertebrates occurs naturally insect specieswolbachia occur naturally aedes aegypti scientists tried inject mosquito’s eggs luck  zhiyong xi doctoral student university kentucky found way wasn’t genetic modification key mosquitoes born infected eggs infected — including eggs way infection continuesa wolbachiainfected female pass infection offspring whether mate infected uninfected female however can’t offspring infected male eggs hatch females mate once gives wolbachiainfected mosquitoes transmission advantageresearchers variety locales enduring tropical diseases testing several ways employ wolbachia world mosquito program aims replace local mosquito population wolbachiainfected population infected mosquitoes forming larger larger proportion total generationthe program releases male female wolbachiainfected mosquitoes places traps catch mosquitoes stops releases percentage mosquitoes found infected reaches critical point townsville percent two consecutive weeksthe infected mosquitoes’ transmission advantage enough tip population mosquitorelease areas townsville nearly mosquitoes wolbachia infected remained stable in neighborhoods however wolbachia’s control fluctuated program release additional mosquitoesit’s great public health single treatment campaign provides lasting effects help governments cheaply job done governments there’s little profit it said professor scott o’neill dean science monash university melbourne directs mosquito program “we business model”the program working governments run field tests countries including australia vietnam indonesia brazil colombia sri lanka rio de janeiro project covers  million people medellín covers million both scaling quick response zika several places program working national coverage far results reported australia yogyakarta indonesia excellent dr o’neill said colleagues worried communities’ reaction program “but people understand dengue live transmission areas horrified scared” said “i live saigon transmission roof we’re seeing community pushback”the cost program townsville  per person covered it’s sprawling city place like rio people live closer together cost  per person might save rio money all it’s onetime cost treating dengue zika expensive babies zikarelated microcephaly may need lifelong care dr o’neill said hoped get cost  per personthe program’s strategy replacing bad mosquitoes good ones disadvantages well unfortunately doesn’t reduce number mosquitoes bitesalso there’s tradeoff better wolbachia blocking disease weakens mosquito weaker mosquitoes less able spread population maintain hold world mosquito program using best wolbachia strain possible said dr xi involved program “but technology needs improved able develop mosquito completely block virus still able spread population”dr xi professor michigan state university uses wolbachia different way eliminate mosquito population heads research collaboration msu sun yatsen university universities built mosquito factory guangzhou china dr xi also leading project autonomous university yucatán start another factory merida mexico china factory produce million wolbachiainfected male mosquitoes per week said unlike replacement strategy elimination strategy releases males sexsorting expensive difficult essentially mosquitoes put giant sieve separates males larger females releasing males makes possible clear area mosquitoes existing females uninfected mate infected male eggs won’t hatch population gradually reducedthis strategy creates double attack dengue zika infected mosquitoes don’t transmit disease population dwindles point can’t keep epidemic going could also get warmer welcome local residents mosquitoes released males don’t biteit disadvantages sexsorting costly it’s imperfect — letting even females fatal project important gains don’t last mosquitoes fly untreated areas reestablish colony project must start anew every year“if release mosquitoes every year keep numbers down becomes business” said dr andrea gloriasoria evolutionary biologist agricultural research scientist connecticut agricultural experiment station “which don’t like problems mostly thirdworld country problems there’s money there”in guangzhou dr xi working local officials test combination strategy last three years mosquitoes infected wolbachia zapped lowdose radiation sterilizes females said mosquito population dropped percent average areas completely eliminated mosquitoesmost americans don’t worry dengue zika — yet — would love see fewer mosquitoes dr stephen dobson professor entomology university kentucky founded mosquitomate forprofit company works mosquitoabatement programs united states mosquitomate’s largest projects fresno calif miami acres treated city one unexpected partner fresno verily lifesciences division google’s parent company alphabet verily trying use machines algorithms raise sort release monitor wolbachia mosquitoesdr dobson said mosquito populations drop percent — larger area stronger effect it’s expensive sells service individual homeowners lexington ky pay   weekly mosquito releases summerany time play god nature need worry consequences wolbachia natural — insect species already carry it possible environmental impact far less create spraying scientist talked worried wolbachia could help mosquitoes transmit new diseases hiv — which let us give thanks mosquitoborne mosquitoes particular viruses transport “mosquitoes aren’t flying syringes” dr dobson saidwhat’s much likely benefits wolbachia won’t last point pathogens certain evolve resist wolbachia evolve resist insecticides dr gloriasoria said elimination strategy might better able stave resistance must start year “you could put slightly different strains wolbachia” said “it’s like getting new insecticide”but said pathogens could increase use other less efficient kinds mosquitoes “if eliminate aedes aegypti australia still aedes albopictus” said “other mosquitoes play minor roles could become better vector niche open that’s nature works”tina rosenberg pulitzer
