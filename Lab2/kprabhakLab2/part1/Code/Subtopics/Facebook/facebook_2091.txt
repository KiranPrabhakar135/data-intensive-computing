planetwarming carbon dioxide atmosphere rate faster point human history since beginning industrialization october united nations intergovernmental panel climate change released become known “doomsday” report — “a deafening piercing smoke alarm going kitchen” one united nations official described — detailing climate effects  two degrees celsius warming    degrees fahrenheit opening major united nations conference two months later david attenborough mellifluous voice bbc’s “planet earth” environmental conscience englishspeaking world put even bleakly “if don’t take action” said “the collapse civilizations extinction much natural world horizon” scientists felt way while often talked like it decades things worse reputation “alarmism” among studying climate change bit strange don’t typically hear public health experts need circumspection describing risks carcinogens instance climatologist james hansen testified congress global warming  called phenomenon “scientific reticence” chastised colleagues — editing observations conscientiously failed communicate dire threat actually was tendency metastasized even news research grew bleaker years publication every major paper essay book would attended cloud commentary debating precise calibration perspective tone many articles seen scientists lacking appropriate balance bad news optimism labeled “fatalistic” result  circumspection began change perhaps extreme weather wouldn’t permit to scientists even began embracing alarmism — particularly united nations report research summarized new temperatures beyond two degrees celsius even discussed though warming scale headed though report — product nearly scientists around world — address scarier possibilities warming offer new form permission world’s scientists thing new message ok finally freak out even reasonablethis me progress panic might seem counterproductive we’re point alarmism catastrophic thinking valuable several reasonsthe number people projected experience heat

intergovernmental panel climate change  new york timesthe first climate change crisis precisely looming catastrophe demands aggressive global response now words right alarmed emissions path today likely take us  degrees celsius warming  two degrees celsius within decades perhaps four degrees celsius  temperatures rise could mean many biggest cities middle east south asia would become lethally hot summer perhaps soon  would icefree summers arctic unstoppable disintegration west antarctic’s ice sheet scientists believe already begun threatening world’s coastal cities inundation coral reefs

many reasons think may get four degrees celsius globally emissions still growing time avert thought catastrophic warming — two degrees celsius — shrinking day stay safely threshold must reduce greenhouse gas emissions percent levels  according united nations report instead still rising alarmed sign hysterical comes climate change alarmed facts demand perhaps logical responsethis helps explain second reason alarmism useful defining boundaries conceivability accurately catastrophic thinking makes easier see threat climate change clearly years read newspapers two degrees warming invoked highest tolerable level beyond disaster would ensue warming greater rarely discussed outside scientific circles easy develop intuitive portrait landscape possibilities began climate exists today ended pain two degrees ceiling sufferingin fact almost certainly floor far likeliest outcomes end century fall two four degrees warming looking squarely world might look like range — two degrees three four — much better preparation challenges face retreating comforting relative normalcy presentthe third reason concern climate change growing — fortunately — complacency remains much bigger political problem fatalism december national survey tracking americans’ attitudes toward climate change found percent said global warming happening highest percentage since question began asked  majority americans unwilling spend even  month address global warming drew line  month according poll conducted previous month last fall voters washington green state bluewave election rejected even

percent per year stay safely two degrees warming fail act thought already didn’t yet consider warming urgent enough problem take action against percent surveyed survey last month cited climate change top political priority be fact is delay make problem worse started broad decarbonization effort today — gargantuan undertaking overhaul energy systems building transportation infrastructure produce food — necessary rate emissions reduction would percent per year delay another decade require us cut emissions percent year united nations secretarygeneral antónio guterres believes change course get
