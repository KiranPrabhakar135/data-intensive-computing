scientists say instances splitsex animals insects could offer clues human diseases strike one sex other researchers thought figured genetics birds bees gynandromorphs suggest learn said jennifer marshall graves distinguished professor la trobe university melbourne australia mammals x chromosomes birds insects z w reptiles change sex depending temperature combination temperature sex chromosomes saidit believed sex bird determined protein made dmrt gene would reach cells bird bloodstream dr graves said two sides bird share bloodstream sex must storyhormones can’t sole drivers sex either likely play role said arthur arnold distinguished research professor university california los angeles paper published pnas dr arnold showed gynandromorphic zebra finches brain cells female

understood said process unlikely happen mammals said female mammals naturally two sex chromosomes instant mammalian egg sperm fuse “dramatic changes prevent entry second sperm”gynandromorphs occur naturally usually resulting random genetic error dr patel said phenomenon inherited — flies moths passing unstable sex chromosomes offspring said also possible stress cause unusual sex split it’s impossible track entire population understand percentage unusual sex chromosomes dr patel said lab scientists used radiation create gynandromorph flies said difficult sort potential causes — including environmental harm — wild populationwhy cells opposite sex end opposite sides gynandromorphs remains unclear dr arnold said “i don’t good explanation” saidalthough many birds studied roughly percent male one side percent female other study chickens showed cells weren’t evenly distributed animals also develop mosaics cells genetically different others dr patel’s butterflies instance show male coloration patterns parts wing rather entire side dr arnold said research sex genes implications treating variety human diseases seem vary gender ucla collaborator rhonda voskuhl found instance multiple sclerosis genetically female mouse two x chromosomes fares worse mouse x y even hormones understanding females fare worse could help explain treat ms people also gender difference women accounting three times many cases menobesity metabolic syndrome autoimmune disease alzheimer’s even aging differs sex dr arnold noted twenty years ago said scientists didn’t think sex chromosomes played role causing sex differences diseases “but know makes difference mice say make difference humans” saida better understanding role sex disease would eventually enable better treatments said “that’s kind hope — sex differences important understanding diseases men women also developing fundamental understanding disease processes manipulate them” dr arnold said cases losing chromosome extra one lethal said jeannie lee geneticist expert x chromosome harvard medical school massachusetts general hospital like science times page facebook  sign science times newslettermost people chromosomes inherited parent chromosomes come extra copy including chromosomes  — commonly called syndrome losing chromosome second sex chromosome always lethal fetusbut sex chromosome one people survive one copy dr graves said “girls single x suffer anomalies second x largely inactive anyway all males one x” said people anomalous numbers sex chromosomes turner syndrome range problems virtually issues infertility heart problems cognitive impairment one  girls born turner syndrome also possible people intersex born reproductive sexual anatomy doesn’t fit typical definitions female male may involve sex chromosomes according intersex society north america advocacy groupit clear mechanisms body ensure men get one women get two x chromosomes said karissa sanbonmatsu structural biologist principal investigator los alamos national laboratory new mexico typical females one x usually — always — turned off said research suggests mechanism counts many x chromosomes present generally turns one themthe interplay genetics hormones complicated said “genetics produce hormones hormones reprogram dna” said might explain mismatch people sex chromosomes sex hormones “that’s speculative” dr sanbonmatsu said adding “it’s hard get funding kind research”people androgen insensitivity syndrome instance born xy chromosomes develop female cells cannot process male hormones “so it’s testosterone doesn’t exist” said infertilethe science learns sex “the find anomalies” said alice dreger historian sexuality “nature’s dealing conformity time brutal ways loving ways rest it” dr dreger said “it doesn’t follow human fantasy everybody normal humans don’t follow ridiculous idea either”
