green new deal leftist fantasywith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardti’m ross douthat “the argument” week green new deal symbolize future democratic party leftist overreachyou can’t promise everything expect taken seriouslythen brexit deadline looming england dodavid britain independent i’m sorry interjectthe lovechild andrew dice clay little girl “brave” that’s actually kind it goldberg laughsthe green new deal hot policy topic moment measure drafted representative alexandria ocasiocortez senator edward markey proposes grand strategy combat climate change creating jobs usit includes year commitment convert percent power demand us clean renewable zeroemission energy sources upgrade existing buildings meet energy efficiency requirements expand highspeed rail also includes lot commitments — universal health care living wage even job guarantee — don’t usually get described “green” critics measure calling leftist overreach socialism disguised climate reform david’s sitting conversation out he’ll back second segment colleague michelle cottle joining us dc hey michelleso michelle g i’m fascinated green new deal means democrats you’re closer issue am what’s impressionit’s sort astonishing green new deal incarnation gone something talked about know among small group democratic socialists new york something democratic candidates president signed to proposal based — it’s combination like know lot people said it’s combination climate mitigation social democracy i’ve talked people close alexandria ocasiocortez close organizations mobilized behind green new deal make couple different arguments one argument you’re talking fundamental restructuring economy are need give people safety net right there’s going losers you’re talking transforming whole industries way make palatable people make sure good jobs they’re going lose health care process changing jobs argue actually things actually go together argument think goes scope ambition think intuited essentially era reagan come end set assumptions governed american politics since ronald reagan played we’re cusp something new there’s opportunity chart horizon would be right opportunity sort chart the like ideological umbrella we’re going operating going forward know think see way makes sense really go big sort grand mission statement want organizing values society beyeah mean i’m genuinely fascinated politics seems bears resemblance radical ideas tend float around republican party politics primary campaigns on ideas usually like flat tax “   ” or know we’re going abolish six cabinet agencies on what’s striking fast we’ve gone conceived basically socialist flank democratic party blueprint much aggressive version sort centrist green new deal ideas someone like colleague tom friedman would champion joined pitch social democracy democratic presidential candidates signing onto it prominent people running democratic nomination feeling like something get board withright although sort think signing green new deal theory opposed signing specifics right mean michael bloomberg run going champion something he’s going call green new deal probably pretty different know actual meat they’ve proposed here i’m sure everyone says “yes support green new deal” necessarily supports components particular nonbinding resolutionno think think that’s fair still sense — there’s felt sense like opportunity distance wackier ideas left anything like that pressure moment say even doubts details you’re something like this michele c i’m curious nancy pelosi much quoted remark referred green new deal “the green dream whatever call it” interpreted people suggesting wanted keep certain distance i’m wondering — part democratic party right really worried they’re dragged far lefti don’t know they’re worried yet they’re far there’s lot skepticism think speaker pretty clear aiming keep anybody running amok mean make comment “green dream” mean given special climate change committee subpoena power tasked hammering “green new dream” cottle laughs talking best grandmother voice much likes enthusiasm behind plan patronizing sound said knows she’s got new enthusiastic cohort contend with looking kind go headtohead muchyou know think there’s disjunction necessary possible makes ways sort sides debate seem irrational right mean it’s true ocasiocortez people proposing know current circumstances going happen would need like huge political change actually get anything close done think it’s also true really take scale problem seriously — finished book david wallace wells called “the uninhabitable earth” climate change going mean people society coming decades don’t know anybody could read kind feel sense alarm sense everything possible needs done keep us going upper estimates global warming could look like sense thing would say green new deal maybe it’s ambitious enough that know there’s things include doesn’t actually think nothing mainstream democrats going to aren’t going roll eyes understand limits political system going sufficient crisisyeah one things you’re talking democratic skeptics — want make distinction climate deniers whatever we’re talking centrist democrats understand argument you’re going make huge economic changes need provide security sense safety net hand democrats like can’t promise everything expect taken seriously blueprint actual action treat like vision statement treat wish list you’re sitting around fantasizing friends democratic party be green new deal people focusing green part really talks promoting social justice talks know family leave retirement security health care it’s throwing everything kitchen sink plan vision statement pick apart work with it’s also going get made fun one’s going take seriously legislative kind of roadmapwell mean one’s going take seriously mean obviously lot people taking seriously right mean that’s many people signing it don’t think —well mean people rushing cosponsor taking politically seriously even don’t think going enacted a know grand legislative package next couple years roadmap sort laws new generation democrats would like enact take powersure talk democrats they’re betting people who’ve signed haven’t read thing half idea what’s there think hasn’t reached point yet anybody drilled down question necessarily virtue signalling definitely a know need stand something kind generally agree direction need work make more don’t know concrete maybebut mean part what’s fascinating political assumptions undergirding assumptions goal democrats basically to climate find something could someday get republican votes basically win big enough hopefully nearfuture election start passing things  let’s say votes postfilibuster landscape full tilt progressive majority mean much climate policy us developed world built around idea getting rightofcenter parties buy carbon taxes kind technocratic solution green new deal enthusiastic carbon taxes particularly sort says well know approach might fine really want spend much money possible sort throw money problem big strategic shift climate debateright think underlying shift — know think it’s mistake talk carbon taxes it’s mistake tie green new deal believe to know call modern monetary theory right theory sort spend unlimited amounts currency absent catastrophic inflation talk people — like i’m thinking conversation sean mcelwee who’s really significant figure new new left founded group called data progress poll tests lot ideas said something like argument center left republican party unreasonable can’t talk them there’s sort nothing us debate they’re going sign anything it’s kind fool’s errand try craft something would appeal them actually think legislative history last years suggests that’s casedo think michele c democrats sort center left care issue imagine working republicans point near futureyeah think always especially senate you’re dealing people think terms compromise best deal possible mean politics art possible level green new deal strikes trying pull democratic party similar way tea party pulled republican party right trying make sure democratic party doesn’t know kind get swept along much toward center right it’s reminding progressive values need kind come back lot issues toward leftand michelle g someone little older progressives working right bears battle scars from know long wars conservatives confidence make nervousyou know thing makes nervous confidence like people agree us polls right people agree sorts social democratic proposals they’re phrased certainly polls and know experience politics like many years like vastly overestimating degree american people agree usbut what’s — is me mean said something slightly dismissive modern monetary theory that’s weakest part plan observer that know that’s risky part plan politically it’s actually certain ways least crazy part rightright they’re smart they’re smart right it’s sort centrist fantasy carbon taxes practical way proposals pie — know see carbon taxes practical see proposals pie sky i’m sure actually matches political realityno don’t think all mean think basically green new deal says order get people buy this we’re going tell it’s going cost much know we’re going put credit card hope basically spend way energy breakthrough inflation spiral hits don’t know that’s crazier rightalthough fair learned republican party last couple years deficits don’t matter right whatever want cut taxes much want spend whatever want nobody really cares least certainly don’t days partand they’re also — they’re also correct surmising cost climate change going astronomicalbut it’s cost paid across decades decades society that least hope steadily richer richer today whereas green new deal basically saying we’re going take tremendous economic gamble front right now know sort of know won’t call sovietstyle year plan it’s year plan assumption upfront cost less sort distributed cost timeso worry balance use this one democrat noted organizing tool vision statement whatever realpolitik situation of point disappoint base haven’t managed years solve everything oppression indigenous people family leave health care wind fairly bitter left assumption kind thought going happeni don’t know sort think left bitter feel like leaders didn’t even tryyeah think conversation needs started democratic party stand for mean problem hillary clinton campaign think far like new vision democrats stand conversation needs startedare democrats conservatives  they’re sort poised ideological revolution reshape things long time green new deal part it republicans tea party republicans  thought poised ideological revolution many structural roadblocks american politics came griefi mean think are mean like think conservative movement feel like ways revolution going happen sort demographically right mean millennials much diverse left wing generation them going believe biggest voting bloc kind politically significant going forward they’re followed generation that’s left wing are political transformation know democratic party overreliant demographics nonetheless know young people going replace usmichelle c honored guest want give last word extent alexandria ocasiocortez really setting agenda kamala harris elizabeth warren cory booker right nowi think kind discussion that’s going happen early primaries weeds enough real issue course climate change going issue social justice economic fairness general be don’t think it’s going take center stageok i’m curious fully becomes aoc’s party i’m observer really excited moment lot fun michelle want stick around just — brexit segment come back recommendationfantastic right we’re going take quick break come back david going mc debate future united kingdombrexit you’ve seen lot headlines britain’s plans leave european unionbut i’m gonna go limb guess haven’t read many stories brexit seems complicated repetitive you’re american feel far away i’ve become fascinated brexit want share fascination segment brexit actually complicated happen next month two shape future britain europe western world today we’re gonna debate brexit we’re going ask make decision britain would do get let give basics  british public voted leave european union trading zone known euthis means uk voted leave european union cheeringbut ballot initiative didn’t get details leave neither british parliament british people agree details three options come next option one known “hard brexit” it’s happen parliament doesn’t anything else next weeks britain leave eu come march  agreements europe travel food shipping name it cancelled option two middle ground “soft brexit” one theresa may prime minister pushing britain would leave eu would still abide europe’s rules still get benefits trouble option two soft people support “hard brexit” it’s way much nearly half britain voted leaving first place option three over it’s hold another vote option obvious problems would essentially nullify vote british people advocates revote say people didn’t realize brexit really voted back  another chance vote understand three options britain must choose one today i’m joined two excellent guests help decide one steve hilton used top adviser david cameron british prime minister set brexit motion steve lives us written book called “positive populism” favors “hard brexit” colleague roger cohen opinion columnist former foreign editor times recently wrote impassioned case revote steve roger welcome “the argument”steve go first please lay us “hard brexit” would look likeyes view “hard brexit” really brexit reason say nature brexit vote about really national independence sovereignty heart argument leaving eu wasn’t really trade economics country electing people could make decisions goes country accountable people look eu way works it’s really one giant institutionalised violation democratic norms because experienced worked downing street mentioned activity uk government implementing decisions made eu sense eu like trade deal european version nafta better comparison federal government america difference least federal government elected least president elected congress elected whereas eu force driving policy forward eu commission elected it’s appointed sense alternatives “hard brexit” end still leave uk government subject rules developed implemented unelected body based brussels sense it’s brexit all that’s way actually fulfil vote majority vote leave eu known “hard brexit”now i’ve read lot descriptions “hard brexit” might look like describe — let’s imagine it’s march actually get “hard brexit” think brexit think actually looks like doesn’t scare much scares lot peoplebecause uk left eu would like countries world eu countries manage perfectly well live trade prosper outside member eu take specific examples mentioned frequently worried “hard brexit” they’ve knocked back every single time people really know that’s me good example terms flights where hear time flights won’t able take land air travel completely disrupted they’re perfectly prepared situation uk eu one big problems think argument everything would grind halt isn’t negotiated outcome asserts far much primacy think bureaucracy government terms society economy really works end businesses want sell other companies want trade other countries want get along other that’s countries world operate don’t happen members eu think overblown don’t want say there’ll disruption would ridiculous idea can’t cope think completely overstatedroger know you’re much worried prospect “hard brexit”yeah sure david infinite respect steve notion david cameron’s government kind stenographer european union absurd britain european union however euro control monetary policy currency britain sovereign nation slogan brexiteers called “take back control” take back control what well take back control borders take back control monetary policy no nostalgic fantasy essence foist european union bolstered series lies lies turkey join european union million turks descend britain lies money would given nhs britain three hundred fifty million pounds week going eu could spent nhs “hard brexit” mean hope isn’t one could have certainly chaos ireland hard border would immediately go up point i’m hoping labour see light despite jeremy corbyn plenty — democracy think again know united states think couple years president trump wants to taken fantasy brexit  reality brexit know terms it want it want may’s deal want deal want remain would make sensesteve let ask you feel like story leavers probrexit crowd told british people british people actually chance see details brexit seem like story told wasn’t consistent reality wrong thatno there’s real truth that say there reason leavers ended running process process actually got taken various kind catastrophic misjudgments quickly vote sort internal warfare within conservative party needn’t bore listeners with end result people made positive exciting open arguments britain could thrive prosper turn back europe actually continue engage europe also outward looking engage wider world lost people made arguments didn’t end running process theresa may ended running process was let’s remember leaving staying within eu just one quick thing i’d say point agreement roger think important say he’s absolutely right it’s correct try blame eu things gone wrong contributed vote i’ve argued along real answer leaving eu newfound freedom you’ve left centerpiece got policy example equip people skills prosper st century economy building infrastructure sorts things roger’s correct nothing eu agree thatand britain way become independent can’t now like sort reagan revolution britaindavid britain independent i’m sorry interjectbritain independent steve’s phrase one used “newfound freedom” i’m sorry newfound freedom — anyone visiting britain last   years felt unfree countryno completely agree it’s freedom citizens live there it’s freedom people government people elect actually implement policy mean know government implementing eu directives freedom i’m talking mainly regulatory arenaok roger let ask revote mean britain voted percent percent leave think lot people including people really brexit find idea essentially saying “you know actually vote country doesn’t count let’s again” worrisome feels antidemocratic walk us think revote right thing doi don’t think good outcomes good outcome david think it’s best options point said steve steve think heard correctly agreed vote held basis series lies misleading statements denmark ireland eu members reconsidered earlier votes decision ages decision next two three generations suppose it’s conceivable britain come could think even know vote thinking referendum came percent favour staying eu think people say there’ll blood streets britain divided britain divided fierce contentious debatesteve part would actually welcome second vote win remove doubt british people wantyes i’m implacably opposed second vote think certainty needed above clarity certainty what’s going happen that’s that’s argument “hard brexit” least know stand people plan accordingly also applies second vote think it’s like second best option “hard brexit” much better continuing debate forever ever think there’s couple observations i’d make though first all there’s one vote brexit there’s actually two votes brexit there’s general election general election big majority candidates got elected parliament ran promise would implement brexit secondly think advocate this think assumption britain voted would would reverse vote don’t think safe assumption all think anger generated request vote might play part also remember look opinion polls know — campaign got going first time looked outlandish idea people would vote leave don’t rely getting different result third point i’d make proponents second referendum say look know it’s about people didn’t full information would recall campaign leaving remain campaign entire message based worstcase scenario things we’re hearing attached deal exit think it’s accurate say people voting basis different information you’d new information think it’d arguments entirely again might get resultlet make briefly version theresa may case look deal consistent vote british people “hard brexit” crowd wants it’s certainly remain crowd wants moves britain little europe honoring vote isn’t — muddle option — isn’t likely fairest option here steve don’t go firsti think it’s likely problem everything said true lasts two years it’s transition agreement long term agreement arguments things we’re discussing now completely consuming political debate uk — whether single market whether customs union kind trading relationship citizens living other’s countries — things still unresolved theresa may’s plan plan withdrawal agreement it’s transition agreement answer to “what future relationship britain eu” that’s think prolongs uncertainty that’s think it’s badi agree steve think likely just think prime minister trying run clock scare people think it’s better steve’s proposal of know “let’s get it” again get back enormity decision foisted upon people lies britain chance think againwell one reasons i’m absorbed story it’s legitimately uncertain don’t know what’s going happen next five six weeks really appreciate coming hope you’ll willing come back find what’s actually going happen next two monthsthank roger thank steve listeners really want know three options would pick opinion call leave us voicemail    play britain tell us you’d may play showso michelle michelle back — get kick saying — weekly recommendation week it’s michelle g stands goldberg’s
