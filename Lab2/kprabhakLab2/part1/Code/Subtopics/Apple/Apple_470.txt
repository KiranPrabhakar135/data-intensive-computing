abortion debatewith ross douthat michelle goldberg david leonhardti’m david leonhardt “the argument” week we’re taking look abortion laws around countrythere sort zone abortions prochoice side defending americans middle don’t supportthen “medicare all” could ever actually workwe’re wealthiest country world wayi need say ross younger me laughslast week video virginia statehouse created political firestorm showed democratic legislator kathy tran making case bill would remove abortion restrictions among things thirdtrimester abortions would available even woman’s health risk response prolife advocates swiftthe move sparking outcry across country many americans asking okthey said video proof democrats supported livebirth abortions prochoice side called charge false national debate ensued state union address president trump made sure mention abortioni asking congress pass legislation prohibit lateterm abortion childrensince started podcast heard listeners asking us conversation abortion subject michelle ross write regularly different perspectives today day we’re going get it michelle don’t start you break us exactly bill proposesso first kathy tran delegate introduced legislation it’s introduced many many past legislative sessions would basically take away restrictions thirdtrimester abortion virginiain existing law needs three doctors need testify would deeply harm health motherright existing law need say would substantially impair mental physical health woman kathy tran testifying she’s presented hypothetical really ridiculous kind insulting rightby republican right like “what woman dilating she’s deliver baby gets certification abortion could bill”mr chairman would a know decision doctor physician woman would make pointi understand that i’m asking bill allows thatyou know said like “hypothetically yes never happen” instead said yes would allowed goes viral “prochoice radicals want abortion delivery table” ralph northam radio and—right virginia governor virginia governor who addition egregious racist also pediatric neurologist he’s asked basically says he think  seems logical explanation he’s talking  he’s basically saying situation pregnancy failing situation fetus know going survive you’re delivery table sort of situation hypothetical republican lawmaker presented here’s would actually happen woman would deliver baby would resuscitated parents would make decision conservatives heard thought “oh god they’re trying pass law could basically change mind baby you’re middle labor killed afterwards” know marco rubio’s tweeting it ben sasse wants sort resolution prohibit thing doesn’t happen sort legislation propaganda because know you’re kind banning something you’re basically admitting think it’s thing first place reignited debate thirdterm abortionand get ross favor legislation feel like look apply tiny number cases heartbreaking cases extremely difficult circumstances babies dying don’t want put bureaucratic hurdles — legal hurdles — front mothers situationsso super clear actually don’t know actually isn’t good data reasons women seek thirdtrimester abortions mean know one reason women seek thirdtrimester abortions essentially form miscarriage management right pregnancy sort failing time there’s actually places nothing law allows medical system deal women circumstance right women carry failing pregnancies weeks or know forced kind go stillbirths would preferred terminate two months earlier think probably cases going allowed law would probably consider morally abhorrent greater danger reform trying — let’s clear reform isn’t happening right something proposed delegate never chance passing even though we’re talking it’s become subject national controversy know really close relationship ob right can’t imagine situation get permission two doctors decided bestross know think bill differently terms would also terms important because you’ve pointed out new york state example actually passed version law take us thoughts lawso guess it’s useful think terms of sort of two sets cases antiabortion side side argument thinking argue bill talk viral video clip like one right first set cases relate specifically happens infants  former fetuses turned babies  either born alive course lateterm abortion potential world born alive terrible medical condition serious disability on that’s very small number cases especially first case do fact exist right lot legal uncertainty happens cases allowed cases whether legal right life being creature time thing prolife side trying highlight arguments argument abortion weeks extends perfectly reasonably back abortion weeks abortion weeks on very abortions united states take place weeks lot abortions us take place basically line second third trimesters pregnancy various estimates —that would weeks right reason bills become flashpoint possibility infants killed outside mother’s womb rare real also fact there’s larger argument here right stake question whether fetus human kind rights has talking reality that know moment legally something ceases fetus becomes baby passing mother that’s way highlighting fact terms being ontology will doesn’t change moment changes back pregnancy incredibly gradual changes are  person mushy middle  can know use person mushy middle michelle laughs appalled admittedly extreme possibility unborn baby aborted weeks might appalled thing happening weeks we’ve tugged little bit towards think correct take abortion abhorrent be cases legally permittedfirst all obviously can’t speak prochoice movement sense that talking reluctance people prochoice side extend protections babies born botched abortion afraid extending  least personally  it’s i’m afraid extending legal rights baby would sort raise question set legal rights shouldn’t adhered know minutes earlier it’s there’s law infanticide right point view see laws trying — again see sort legal propaganda — trying instantiate law prohibitions something made clear either happens happen already illegal thing appreciate ross says kind admits people prochoice side know point laws sort thin edge wedge broader quest make abortion illegalsure similarly appreciate michelle conceding inherent prochoice position tolerance something language morally abhorrent order protect greater good women’s rights on right think we’ve sort admitted something interest think it’s important understand debate right mean prolife side interesting position country set abortions largely legal america generally legal supreme court jurisprudence would legal countries extremely unpopular right poll abortion weeks poll thirdtrimester abortion it’s      kind issue prochoice side political advantage even though prolife side it’s also great human tragedy right sort zone abortions prochoice side defending americans middle don’t support offer prochoice side makes — david — all laugh basically say “you know understand don’t agree us first secondtrimester abortion illegal agree us much it’s reasonable move make still option listen us two trimesters won’t come along us far” michelle saying “but look they’re admitting want go further” reality that do right it’s case prolifers dishonest like even prolife premise particular horror thirdtrimester abortions right prolife view would look abortion always form murder various forms murder murdering conscious sentient form human life worse first trimester there’s consistent prolife case thinking abortion outlawed thirdtrimester abortions especially said allowing real complexities human life necessity certain legal exceptions outlawedso people point that know european countries abortion typically tightly regulated after don’t don’t even know think —right think that know prochoice people — think us — would say well that’s compromise we’ll take it would happily trade situation abortion free widely available uncontested first trimester exchange sorts restrictions reason we’re willing sign sorts restrictions there’s reason people end waiting long there’s reason people end money troubles it’s restrictive series abortion laws ends pushing women secondtrimester right there’s something sort perverse saying prochoice perspective saying “well know europe they’re willing draw line aren’t willing draw line” think prochoice people vast majority us even sort like hardcore would willing make europeanstyle compromise depends level social trust restrictions aren’t sort trojan horses meant take away women’s access abortion altogetheri mean way read polls three groups americans think they’re broadly similar size maybe one group closer percent one closer  group americans basically want abortion almost circumstances legal side group americans want abortion legal almost circumstances group middle who depending ask questions answer different ways basically favor abortion legal circumstances also favor restrictions rightand numbers — jump — remarkably steady last yearsremarkably steady certainly find one agonizing issue two middle group would always — forced choose label would always choose prochoice find issue unlike many issues unavoidable clash rights rights mother rights fetus baby right gay marriage see clash rights voting see clash rights issue see unavoidable clash rights often heartbreaking clash rights one hand think many examples brought prolife side rarerthanrare examples describe experiences american women — anywhere near most side think really really tricky things idea unregulated abortion countrywell don’t unregulated abortion countryno get there many states extremely regulated abortion regulated would likebut mean think push little bit question sort compromises right think know prolife side looks places prochoice side power right political liberalism power scandinavia new york state doesn’t see you’re describing michelle doesn’t see world prochoice side willing eager thirdtrimester restrictions long abortion readily available first two trimesters fact sees situations permissive laws high abortion rates right think think there’s conceit prochoice side make good things go together — that “oh know prolife laws just know just sort create abortions end women wait long on” reality go state state us highest abortion rates places permissive laws it’s would expect isn’t world prochoice side takes power suddenly they’re willing compromise ways impose restrictions allwell right think new york passed law passed much celebration right specifically reaction brett kavanaugh supreme court sense supreme court going take roe v wade away us let’s codify rights can like said people prochoice side don’t believe even good faith argument made late term abortions mean —do — let — think isn’t good faith argument made think prolifers don’t think lateterm abortions worse first trimesteri find hard believe people prolife side circumstances evince concern weak vulnerable find passion issue suspiciouscan say one quick thing mean fact could even get prolife people outraged water crisis flint causing epidemic miscarriages right case where kind of government causing mass fetal death see sort solidarity antiabortion movement make fundamentally question good faith concerns certainly themok we’re also dealing difference prolife movement sort institutional force within partisan politics us prolife movement consisting much smaller number americans zealous issue there know look belong roman catholic church right roman catholic church condemned donald trump’s border policies taken amount leftwing positions every issue related health care environment years it’s pretty big important institution maybe less important used be go church read documents put bishops conference don’t see unconcern human life outside —i think that’s true think — think catholic church you’re right catholic church just know particularly people within catholic church consistent life ethic also oppose death penalty mean you’re rightross substantial number people identify prolife who faced lives lives someone family unintended pregnancy change view comes themselves basically say wait second idea forcing woman whether it’s person themselves men women remarkably similar views abortion whether it’s person whether someone’s sister wife people identify prolife faced actual situation unintended pregnancy basically don’t want force woman carry baby way term we’re talking early pregnancies think frequent flip principle personal experience is pretty strong argument favor abortion rights least early pregnancyi mean i’ll honest don’t think i’ve ever known someone prolife sincere way made kind flip think get get kind flip prolife sentiment extremely casual know it’s like well grew red america you’re vaguely prolife you’re confronted reality flip on mean reality like look know legal abortion — like sort difference sort construction understand legal regimes right legal abortion creates incentives right legal abortion it’s possibility inevitably changes think changes people sort decisionmaking structure thinkso michelle question you it’s edge cases right agree often feel hypothetical ludicrous agonizing part this it’s around technology it’s around something starts get close eugenics right it’s around idea increasingly tests say human syndrome look like it’s gonna perfect specimen really uncomfortable world essentially make possible test perfection fetus decide whether fetus gonna allowed live term don’t pretend know construct laws around that makes deeply uncomfortable full notion unrestricted abortion rightsyeah no course mean know obviously stuff makes uncomfortable too think obvious example something i’ve written sexselective abortion asia places too rightwhere basically huge gender imbalances women pay real prices often giving birth daughter there’s real — know there’s real sort material reasons people feel like daughter going put huge disadvantage lot sexselective abortion cases replaced tradition female infanticide case it’s slightly humane alternative it’s still — it’s real problem it’s expression misogyny question then particularly american context something regulate away law without sort infringing women’s rights make decisions don’t reasonbased restrictions country know ways conservative position say think find cultural development really morally troubling without necessarily thinking there’s legal solution it right solution actually cultural much sort policy solution would say it’s make cost caring children disabilities less crushing parents want it reason people pregnant fetus syndrome abortions cavalier think the may bit copout robust social supports welfare state would allow people want raise child syndrome without it without feeling like endangering know future children without feeling going to know without feeling basically consigning life penuryi would say there’s style prolife argument relies possibility reality women abortions cavalier reasons think compelling argument around issue syndrome extreme way every child every birth every kid profound way child accept totalizing burden decades basically rest entire life sense prolife argument saying know is something though sort imposed us nature human condition need supports right think it’s know weakness republican party isn’t offering enough support women wants babies answer care killi actually want end saying thank someone lot questions i’m even sure think aspects this often feel insecure oneonone conversation someone either strongly prolife prochoice really grateful guys willing sit talk other well mostly bystander this thank youwe’re going take quick break we’ll back talk medicare all kamala harris democratic senator presidential candidate recently something surprising called boldest version medicare all version private insurance would go away remarks still sparked debate political left right among progressivesi believe solution i’m actually feel strongly this need medicare all that’s bottom lineadvocates version medicare pointed kaiser family foundation poll showing americans support medicare all skeptics i’m one them noted support plummeted people heard couldn’t private insurance medicare all show called “the argument” wanted air sides issue invited diane archer join us founder medicare rights center president justcareusaorg michelle stepped studio segment she’ll back later welcome diane thank joining usso make case us boldest version medicare all replace rickety system private insurance single payer health care everyone gets health insurance governmenti’m actually going make case version medicare all there’s lot versions medicare medicare many let first define medicare all medicare federally administered health insurance allows people see doctors almost doctors use hospitals anywhere country today million people eligible medicare people people disabilities medicare improves medicare takes away premiums deductibles coinsurance improves benefits adding vision hearing dental home communitybased care expands coverage everyone countryso think heart debate lot people — say lot progressives it’s actually lot people across political spectrum including conservatives — favor expanded government health insurance i’m favor that right get idea senator harris spelled — well appreciated honesty says i’m favor getting rid private health insurance that’s political pipe dream we’re never going get it isn’t polls saw bill clinton’s health care plan fail people thought going lose health care saw main attack obama’s health care reform idea somehow improve health insurance system taking away people’s health insurance may true sort political laboratory it’s never gonna happen it’s kind unforced error democrats talking itactually think it’s thing talking about today system that’s dysfunctional costs control they’re unsustainable people aren’t able get care need know now two big research projects medicare would work financial perspective people would paying less health care percent americans would paying less health care they’re paying today national health spending would go conservative estimates two trillion dollars years estimates much five trillion dollars years afford it makes sense it’s right way go compromise position doesn’t allow us drive costs ensure people access careso actually agree lot substance you’re laying almost think substance isn’t question here cannot fathom world persuade huge numbers americans right private insurance want better health care system worry push mandatory medicare all call medicare all route failure don’t actually get keep improving health system trying make people’s lives better think — cynical political case work persuading people it’s okay don’t right buy private health insurancewell let step back second mentioned earlier recent kaiser survey showing percent public supported medicare all didn’t mention percent public support medicare they’re told eliminates premiums deductibles coinsurance percent public support medicare they’re told guarantees health care human right one asked people whether supported medicare away cost share guaranteed health care human right gave access doctors hospitals throughout country bet asked would even higher numbers percent range really want see it want ability go doctor without worry cost that’s medicare gives themi mean seems like sales pitch offered basically medicare wonderful cost much much less current system deliver much much more right think — most peopleso i’m curious — admirable concession one things see countries canada europe systems comparable succeed driving costs certain ways relative us part dramatic cultural differences people’s expectations system cover look canada instance sort assumption certain know expensive procedures maybe you’re gonna go us get look much doctors paid much hospitals make european countries there’s big difference us here us culture consumerist entitlement applies patients expect doctors expect make hospitals expect make on certain skepticism layer top culture medical entitlement system sales pitch is “this finally pay things find expensive right now” you’re actually going able drive costsa couple points first almost year track record medicare bringing costs giving people care need also know koch brothersfunded study mercatus center conservative —some best friends work mercatus centerthere go go they’re taking consideration fact people using system more know wealthy countries universal health care also far better health outcomes overall half costand main reason would eliminate wasteful care it’s would reduce profits drug companies salaries doctorsgood question reduce cost ways one way get rid lot administrative waste system estimated  billion year federal government negotiating behalf million us bring fairness rationality prices we’re paying health care today two together save lot money system obviously also getting commercial health insurers mix take profits system bring costs furtherit seems that know democrats really one two priorities make existential case — i’m appealing david — top priorities climate change think make financial case top priority little redistribution directly cash could spent medical bills things obamacare experience those liberal would seem attractive another big health care push right now either make argumenti share that meaning — idea next time there’s democratic congress president could could later that idea going go issue bill clinton went failed barack obama went think made lot progress enough lot progress would mistake would much rather see continued push around progress health care democrats made medicare number one push failed failed make progress climate democracy rights inequality would think would really really unfortunateit would unfortunate win know top one top policy issues among americans health care coststhat everybody talking about ross know — i’ve read make point health care doesn’t necessarily deliver better health last week spoke nurse ulcerative colitis daughter gastritis works full time family five husband works full time income  thousand year told back burner treatment ulcerative colitis daughter’s gastritis come first maxed credit card debt ulcerative colitis needs treated going get worse system going spend more ultimately taking care isn’t treating can’t that’s choice shouldn’t making that’s choice shouldn’t forcing anybody make country we’re wealthiest country world way give everybody affordable health care lower cost even want say cost wouldn’t itbut what’s wrong — ask — woman you’re talking health insuranceshe —oh yes health insurance health insurance good health insurance   deductible percent coinsurance payment see doctors use hospitalso guess mean again putting let’s say sherrod brown hat right maybe would say “look we’re going policy that know puts woman range larger earnedincome tax credit or depending old daughter is larger child tax credit five ten thousand dollars disposable income situation pay   copay another person who know different financial difficulty doesn’t flow health care costs also benefit someone might know end spending money unnecessary care won’t right mean guess what’s case woman’s costs opposed to know guy lost job can’t pay kid’s day care somethingi think thing health insurance it’s protect you’re healthy you’re sick nobody knows they’re going need expensive health care right tomorrow could car accident could diagnosed cancer bills lot thousand dollars go hospital days it’s like    thousand dollars earnedincome tax credit going carry throughthe beauty elegance medicare pools risk right brings everybody together broadly distributes costs across everybody you’re healthy it’s spending money you’re sick you’re burdened additional costs commercial health care systembut part what’s going happen system presumably we’ll conversation know years bernie sanders’s second term right — passed law cancer treatments system really going drive costs isn’t going pay for you’re going people difficult situations experimental treatments and know reasonable medicare system — european canadian — part way saves money saying we’re going pay things guess system like that everybody paying much taxes get system there’s expectation promise care there’s going constant political pressure medicare bureaucracy saying “you pay this pay that pay that” stronger insurance companies right now think medicare able say effectively treatmentsi think today we’re saying every day thousands people tens thousands people need treatments time that’s mo people can’t get treatments need here yes obviously can’t pay everything everyone needs astronomical costs medicare going one thing that’s really important set fair prices services right prices really kind of insanelet’s end here it’s democrats actually taken house senate well presidency obviously know side going say right you’re restricting choice you’re taking away people’s insurance saw clinton saw little bit obama give us sense medicare side wins time what’s case makeok it’s education let’s start taking away insurance would say this people don’t like losing insurance embrace medicare all here’s why every year we’re often forced lose insurance employer changes insurers lose job switch jobs insurance decides change terms change doctors effectively losing insurance time medicare get pick doctors want see use hospitals want use it’s guaranteed health care rest life continuity care people don’t yet understand that think embrace it think that’s need do need educate people they’re going pay less they’re going get they’re going able see doctors want see need to without insurance companies coming needs havewell really appreciate coming know lot listeners share view wanted make sure gave full airing promedicare promedicare side remain skeptical it’s going happen also think side winning think guys moved debate long way relatively short time medicare actually happens hope you’ll come back celebratemichelle back us studio time weekly recommendation something take mind
