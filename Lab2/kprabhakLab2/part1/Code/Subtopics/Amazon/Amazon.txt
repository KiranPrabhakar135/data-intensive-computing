The new map reveals that the total aboveground carbon stock of the country is currently 6.9 billion metric tons. But the carbon stocks vary by region and land ownership. The average carbon density for Peruvian rainforests is 99 metric tons of carbon per hectare, with the maximum density of 168 metric tons of carbon per hectare. The largest stocks are in the northern Peruvian Amazon and along the Brazil-Perú border. Regions of deforestation, such as Puerto Maldonado where gold mining has ravaged the area, had low to no carbon storage. The team also assessed 174 protected areas, finding that for every hectare of forest put into protection, an average 95 metric tons of carbon are stored on land, with even more carbon sequestered below the soil surface.Carnegie Science, Independent scientific research, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science, Plant Science, Matter at Extreme States, Genetics and Developmental Biology, Global Ecology, Discovery, Essential Exception, Unconventional, Unconstrained, Small size, big impact, Investigator driven research, Entrepreneurial approach, Exceptional scientists, Internally funded research, Giant Magellan Telescope, Multidisciplinary scientific research, World class paradigm-shifting research, Cell division, Cell nucleus, Cholesterol, Cholesterol metabolism, Chromosome structure, Developmental biology, DNA, Egg production and development, Embryo development, Fat processing, flat fish, frog, fruit fly, Genetic engineering, Genetic Recombination, Lipids, Metamorphosis, mRNA, Nervous system development, Retinal cancer, RNA, Sexual reproduction, Stem cells, Worm, Yeast, Zebrafish, Alternative energy, Astrochemistry, Biomarkers, Diamonds, Earth science, Earth’s interior, Extraterrestrial life, Extreme pressures, Extremophiles, Ferroelectrics, First principles, High-pressure physics, Hydrogen, Hydrogen fuel, Storage, Hydrothermal vents, Life on Mars, Man-made diamonds, Materials science, Meteorites, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnology, Nitrogen cycling, Nitrogen pollution, Origins, Planet evolution, Planet interiors, Planetary exploration, Planetary science, Rise of Earth’s atmosphere, Solar system evolution, Superconductors, Airborne observatory, Amazon ecology, Biosphere II, Carbon cycle, Carbon cycling, Clear cutting, Climate change, Climate change and crop yields, Climate modeling, Desertification, Ecology, Ecosystems, Global climate change, Global warming, Invasive species, Logging in Amazon, Ocean acidification, Rainforest destruction, Remote sensing, Selective logging, Active galactic nuclei, Birth of the universe, Black holes, Cosmology, Dark energy, Dark matter, Distant galaxies, Early universe, Edwin Hubble, Extragalactic distance scale, Extremely large telescopes, Galaxy clusters, Galaxy collisions, Galaxy mergers, Gamma-ray bursts, Globular clusters, Hubble constant, Milky Way, Old galaxies, Origins, Quasars, Stars, Stellar evolution, Universe evolution, X-ray universe, Alternative energy sources, Arabidopsis thaliana, Biofuels, Bioinformatics, Crop improvement, Genetic engineering, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Maize, Nanosensors, Photosynthesis, Plant disease, Plant disease resistance, Plant genetics, Plant nutrients, Plant pest prevention, Seed development, Antarctic meteorites, Asteroids, Astrobiology, Beta Pictoris, Carnegie Caltech planet search, Comets, Continent formation, Core accretion, Dark Matter, Disk instability, Doppler velocity technique, Earthquakes, Exoplanets, Extrasolar planet atmospheres, Extrasolar planets, Extraterrestrial material, Geochronology, Interplanetary dust particles, M-31, Mars, Mercury, MESSENGER Mission to Mercury, Meteorites, Origin of life, Planet formation theory, Plate tectonics, Protoplanets, Search for life, Seismology, Stellar disks, Terrestrial planet formation, Volcanoes

Amazon announced some changes to its user agreement for affiliates, and it could have a significant effect on earnings for those marketers who promote free Kindle ebooks thanks to a brand new clause. The new Amazon Associates Operating Agreement, which governs affiliates' participation in the Amazon Associates Program for amazon.com, go into effect on March 1, 2013.In discussing the changes, affiliates expressed concern over how they would determine how many free ebooks were ordered through their free links. "I can understand and appreciate the rationale for this change, however, since Amazon doesn't report to us how many free Kindle books are "ordered", we are in many ways in a similar situation as with the "friends and family" penalty, i.e. completely in the dark."One seller explained how important the free book marketing was to her model: "Argh! Better start looking for a new idea - this could be the end of me! The point of promoting free books is to get them to click over to Amazon to get the cookie. Even if they "buy" the free book, the cookie is still there for 24 hours. It has been my business base - using free books. I have made quite a bit of money this way."Amazon made other changes to the operating agreement, including decreasing the $50 bounty for cell phones with a wireless service plan to $25. Amazon created a page for affiliates to see the changes to the new operating agreement.Amazon affiliates who promote Kindle eBooks received news last week that the company was changing its operating agreement, and some Amazon affiliates say it will put them out of business.

Believing in magic isn’t just a domain reserved for children. Jan van Ansem discovers his own piece of magic in SAP BW/4HANA on Amazon Web Services (AWS) – and it’s free (well, almost)!The real magic was actually provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). I had read somewhere that AWS and Microsoft Azure both offer BW/4 as a service - apparently free of charge! After some research I found this was only partly true (hence the credit card) but what is absolutely true is that you can run your own BW/4 without having to install any software yourself. A few mouse clicks and a bit of patience and you’re up and running.AWS, Amazon Web Services, Infrastructure as Code, IaC, BW/4HANA, SAP BW/4HANA, BW/4HANA cloud, Enterprise Data Warehouse in the cloud, Developer BW/4HANA

Former Carnegie fellow and current trustee, astronomer Sandra Faber, has been awarded the 2017 Gruber Foundation Cosmology Prize. She was awarded the lifetime achievement award for “her groundbreaking studies of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of galaxies.” Her work provided the impetus to study dark matter, the invisible material that makes up most of the mass of the universe, in addition to  “ the recognition that black holes reside at the heart of most large galaxies."Faber also has a long history of contributing to  innovative telescope technology, and she has “aided and inspired the work of astronomers and cosmologists worldwide.”Carnegie Science, Independent scientific research, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science, Plant Science, Matter at Extreme States, Genetics and Developmental Biology, Global Ecology, Discovery, Essential Exception, Unconventional, Unconstrained, Small size, big impact, Investigator driven research, Entrepreneurial approach, Exceptional scientists, Internally funded research, Giant Magellan Telescope, Multidisciplinary scientific research, World class paradigm-shifting research, Cell division, Cell nucleus, Cholesterol, Cholesterol metabolism, Chromosome structure, Developmental biology, DNA, Egg production and development, Embryo development, Fat processing, flat fish, frog, fruit fly, Genetic engineering, Genetic Recombination, Lipids, Metamorphosis, mRNA, Nervous system development, Retinal cancer, RNA, Sexual reproduction, Stem cells, Worm, Yeast, Zebrafish, Alternative energy, Astrochemistry, Biomarkers, Diamonds, Earth science, Earth’s interior, Extraterrestrial life, Extreme pressures, Extremophiles, Ferroelectrics, First principles, High-pressure physics, Hydrogen, Hydrogen fuel, Storage, Hydrothermal vents, Life on Mars, Man-made diamonds, Materials science, Meteorites, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnology, Nitrogen cycling, Nitrogen pollution, Origins, Planet evolution, Planet interiors, Planetary exploration, Planetary science, Rise of Earth’s atmosphere, Solar system evolution, Superconductors, Airborne observatory, Amazon ecology, Biosphere II, Carbon cycle, Carbon cycling, Clear cutting, Climate change, Climate change and crop yields, Climate modeling, Desertification, Ecology, Ecosystems, Global climate change, Global warming, Invasive species, Logging in Amazon, Ocean acidification, Rainforest destruction, Remote sensing, Selective logging, Active galactic nuclei, Birth of the universe, Black holes, Cosmology, Dark energy, Dark matter, Distant galaxies, Early universe, Edwin Hubble, Extragalactic distance scale, Extremely large telescopes, Galaxy clusters, Galaxy collisions, Galaxy mergers, Gamma-ray bursts, Globular clusters, Hubble constant, Milky Way, Old galaxies, Origins, Quasars, Stars, Stellar evolution, Universe evolution, X-ray universe, Alternative energy sources, Arabidopsis thaliana, Biofuels, Bioinformatics, Crop improvement, Genetic engineering, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Maize, Nanosensors, Photosynthesis, Plant disease, Plant disease resistance, Plant genetics, Plant nutrients, Plant pest prevention, Seed development, Antarctic meteorites, Asteroids, Astrobiology, Beta Pictoris, Carnegie Caltech planet search, Comets, Continent formation, Core accretion, Dark Matter, Disk instability, Doppler velocity technique, Earthquakes, Exoplanets, Extrasolar planet atmospheres, Extrasolar planets, Extraterrestrial material, Geochronology, Interplanetary dust particles, M-31, Mars, Mercury, MESSENGER Mission to Mercury, Meteorites, Origin of life, Planet formation theory, Plate tectonics, Protoplanets, Search for life, Seismology, Stellar disks, Terrestrial planet formation, Volcanoes
The technology, called Rekognition, uses artificial intelligence to identify the objects, people, scenes, and more from images or videos. An Amazon executive touted public safety as a "common use case" for the technology in one presentation. For example, it can be used by law enforcement to recognize and track suspects or "persons of interest" in real time. According to Amazon's website, later versions of the tool can identify up to 100 of the largest faces in an image, meaning it can pull out faces from a crowd.While Amazon may be marketing the technology as a way for law enforcement to more easily catch criminals, civil rights organizations worry it could infringe on privacy rights and be used to target vulnerable populations.The 41 activist groups and entities that cosigned the letter, which include the ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Freedom of the Press Foundation and Human Rights Watch, say the tech "is primed for abuse in the hands of governments.""This product poses a grave threat to communities, including people of color and immigrants, and to the trust and respect Amazon has worked to build," the letter reads. "People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government. Facial recognition in American communities threatens this freedom."Through the Freedom of Information Act, the ACLU obtained emails between Amazon employees and local law enforcement about the facial recognition technology and its usage.In email correspondence with Amazon, the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon said it has roughly 300,000 images in its jail booking photo database that it has uploaded to Rekognition. Those photos are used to compare against images of suspects from security cameras or pictures provided by citizens.The Washington County Sheriff's office said it was using Rekognition to search and identify unknown theft suspects, unconscious or deceased individuals, people of interest who don't have identification, and leads for possible witnesses and accomplices, according to an email obtained by the ACLU.Deputy Jeff Talbot, public information officer at Washington County Sheriff's Office, said in an email to CNNMoney that the technology has been in use for over a year. "During that time, [we] have been transparent and forthcoming so the local public knows what it is, and equally importantly, what it is not."He said "a facial recognition match alone, no matter the percentage match, does not establish probable cause to arrest a suspect" and added images used by the system are ones that have been legally obtained. The sheriff's office pays between $6 and $12 per month to use the service."The Sheriff's Office does not use the technology for mass and/or real time surveillance. In fact, state law and our policy prohibits it for such use," he added.In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said, "Amazon requires that customers comply with the law and be responsible when they use [Amazon Web Services]. When we find that AWS services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right to use our services."The spokesperson stressed that the technology can be used for many other purposes. For instance, it was used to identify guests attending the Royal Wedding last weekend."Our quality of life would be much worse today if we outlawed new technology because some people could choose to abuse the technology," the spokesperson added.Amazon, which announced the tech in November 2016 for customers of its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services, has publicly disclosed that Rekognition customers include the city of Orlando, Florida, as well as the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon.Orlando Police said it is not using the technology in an investigative capacity or in any public spaces "at this time."Late Wednesday night, Amazon sought to correct reports about Orlando's use of AWS technologies after an executive misspoke at an event. The company added a note below a YouTube video of the executive, Ranju Das, saying he "got confused.""It's not correct that they've installed cameras all over the city or are using in production. We apologize for any misunderstanding," Amazon said in the statement.Orlando police say they are trying out the technology. "The purpose of a pilot program such as this, is to address any concerns that arise as the new technology is tested. Any use of the system will be in accordance with current and applicable law," spokespeople for the department said.Amazon's promotional materials previously recommended law enforcement use Rekognition to identify people in police body camera footage, the ACLU said in a post. "The company removed mention of police body cameras from its site after the ACLU raised concerns in discussions with Amazon," according to the ACLU.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon uploaded 300,000 security camera images or pictures provided by citizens to Rekognition. It only uploads mugshots.Update: Amazon says an executive misspoke about the technology being used in conjunction with cameras placed around the city of Orlando.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Washington, D.C.— Gallium arsenide, GaAs, a semiconductor composed of gallium and arsenic is well known to have physical properties that promise practical applications. In the form of nanowires and nanoparticles, it has particular potential for use in the manufacture of solar cells and optoelectronics in many of the same applications that silicon is commonly used.But the natural semiconducting ability of GaAs requires some tuning in order to make it more desirable for use in manufacturing these types of products. New work from a team led by Carnegie’s Alexander Goncharov explores a novel approach to such tuning. Their work is published in Scientific Reports. The research team includes Wei Zhou, Xiao-Jia Chen, Xin-Hua Li and Yu-Qi Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Jian-Bo Zhang of South China University of Technology.Metallic substances conduct electrical current easily, whereas insulating (non-metallic) materials conduct no current at all. Semiconducting materials exhibit mid-range electrical conductivity. When semiconducting materials are subjected to an input of a specific energy, bound electrons can be moved to higher-energy, conducting states. The specific energy required to make this jump to the conducting state is defined as the “band gap.” Fine-tuning of this “band gap” has the potential to improve gallium arsenide’s commercial potential.There are different methods available to engineer slight tweaks to the “band gap.” Goncharov’s team focused on the novel application of very high pressure, which can cause a compound to undergo electronic changes that can alter the electron-carrier properties of materials. It had already been demonstrated on nanowires made from one crystalline form of gallium arsenide--the cubic so-called “zincblende” structure--that the “band gap” widens under pressure.The present research focused instead on nanowires of a less-common crystalline form--the hexagonal so-called “wurtzite” structure. The team subjected “wurtzite” gallium arsenide to up to about 227,000 times normal atmospheric pressure (23 gigapascals) in diamond anvil cells. They discovered the “band gap” that the electrons need to leap across to also widened, although not as much as in the case of the “zincblende” crystal nanowires.Significantly, they discovered that around 207,000 times normal atmospheric pressure (21 gigapascals), the “wurtzite” gallium arsenide nanowires underwent a structural change that induced a new phase, the so-called “orthorhombic” one, which may possibly have metallic electronic properties.“The similarity in behavior when subjected to high pressure, but resulting significant differences in the size of the ‘band gap,’ between the two crystalline structures of gallium arsenide suggests that both types of GaAs structures could theoretically be incorporated into a single device, or even a single nanowire, and realize much more complex and useful electronic functions through interactions across the phases,” Goncharov said. “We believe these findings will stimulate further research into gallium arsenide for both basic scientific and practical purposes.”Caption: A microphotograph of “wurzite” GaAs nanowire in a diamond anvil cell high pressure cavity kept at 99,000 times normal atmospheric pressure (10 gigapascals); a blue spot is from the 488 nm laser spot (about 4 µm in diameter).

Content services today are dominated by video services in the form of TV, movies, sports and gaming plus music streaming services. There has been some major merger and acquisition activity as the traditional media and the telecom industry restructures to deal with new digital players.  Network operators have adopted one of two strategies or tried to mix both – purchasing content producing assets or partnering with content players from the traditional media as well as new digital content players.The first approach is very expensive but can guarantee exclusivity.  The partnership model is a less expensive non-exclusive model that incurs less debt and may offer the best return on capital employed.This report looks at the content propositions of network operators in North America, Europe and selected markets across rest of the world and provides an insight into the strategic approach each operator has taken, before delivering our own analysis of the optimum way forward for network operators looking to retain relevance in a digital world dominated by customer content decisions.Companies: Apple, FAANG, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Oculus, Quibi, AT&T, Verizon,

Brazil:  Amazon and Salvador da Bahia, July 2009 Ben��o with Olodum, Pickpockets, Porto do Barra, Lisa Leaves, Historic Buildings of the Pelourinho Page 12 of 17Lisa and I had come out onto the street.  People were dancing to the drumming of Olodum.  Olodum had performed with Michael Jackson and had been a main fixture in Bahia since 1979.But with the crowds came the danger of pickpockets.  Less than a minute after joining the throng, as I was attempting to take a photo, someone had already unzipped my camera bag.  But I had been prepared since I had been warned repeatedly about theft in the Pelourinho.  I had emptied the pocket, and all of the inner compartment bags were already fastened inside.  I barely glimpsed the blur of a hand darting away.  I couldn't tell who it was. Moments later, a girl, looking rather alarmed, screamed above the din while clutching her purse, "Watch your bag!!!  They're everywhere!!  Watch your bag!!!!"But just two minutes later, someone tried to get into my pants pockets.  There, too, I had been prepared.  I had nothing in my pockets except for a few bills kept in a zipped pocket.  Still, though, I was alarmed that in the span of only several minutes, two attempts at pickpocketing had already been made.After a while, we stopped off to rest and have drinks at the popular Cantinho de Lua on the Terreiro de Jesus before taking a taxi back, running the red lights as was the norm.We walked to a local restaurant with wooden chairs serving fried fish, rice, beans, and salad for 8 reals, then walked out to Porto do Barra.  If this beach were good enough for Caetano Veloso, it'd be good enough for us.Eventually, it was time for Lisa to catch a bus to the airport.  I walked out with her to the bus stop.  I would see her in a week. On the way back, I stopped by the local supermarket to purchase sandwich fixings.  Also, today was Alex's birthday.  We hung out, enjoyed caipirinhas.  Some of us went to drink at Santo Antonio on Rua Recife, then to another bar.  I had wanted to go see some samba at Beco de Gal, but the late night and my growing paranoia from constant warnings and Pelourinho pickpockets made me think that I'd turn in and read a book.In the afternoon, I went to the Pelourinho to try and see the Museu Afro-Brasileiro, but this was closed for renovations.  No matter, the Pelourinho had no shortage of things to do.  I wandered down the cobblestone streets.And they were forced to convert to Catholicism.  After all, a conversion to Catholicism meant that they could worship, marry, and receive a decent burial.I had been to other countries that had European colonial architecture in various stages of decay.  Ghana, India, Burma, Peru, Ecuador, China (Shanghai), all with fascinating balconies, doors, sculptures, all pointing to a fascinating past.travel photos, Ken Lee, Blueberry Buddha, photos, travel, Brazil, Brasil, Amazon, Amazon River,

The 81st annual National Catholic Swimming & Diving Championship is being competed this weekend 1/20-1/21 at Loyola University in Baltimore, Maryland. Many schools from the DMV will compete in this prestigious event that also includes Catholic schools from Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (Full list of teams competing). This is the first of the Championship style meets in 2018 and in last year’s event, Gonzaga captured the boys team title with Georgetown Prep taking second. On the girls side, Holy Cross, Good Counsel, and St. John’s swam and dove to spots 2, 3, and 5 respectively.  This weekend we should see a strong showing from both Georgetown Prep and Gonzaga where one of those two teams will likely take the boys title. (Note: this will be the third meet where Prep and Gonzaga will face off, Gonzaga prevailed in a tri-meet in November, whereas Prep took the dual meet on Jan 10th). On the girls side, Holy Cross is poised to remain in the top three, however a strong Stone Ridge (did not compete last year), Good Counsel and St. John’s teams should also be in contention. As we’ve seen in other Championship events, teams that can place well in the relays and score in diving, will be at the top of the leaderboard. Last year we saw Holy Cross capture 139 of their 277 points from the relay and diving events! We will keep an eye out for results and update as available.Thank you for your support.

We'll be posting the same types of programming tips and tricks in the new blog - along with additional items, such as events, case studies and Forge product roadmap updates.(No more posts will be published on this site, but we'll keep it active for a while to give everyone time to re-bookmark to the new site)Two of my colleagues and I will be attending IoT Tech Expo in London next Monday and Tuesday (23-24 January, 2017). We'll have a booth there where we'll show how Forge can be used in the IoT field, and also take part in panel discussions.The Autodesk Forge DevCon conference, originally scheduled for June 27-28 in San Francisco, will now be held on November 13-14 in Las Vegas.We received feedback from many of last year's Forge DevCon attendees that it was hard to travel to two Autodesk conferences in a year. This change will allow you to attend Forge DevCon and Autodesk University in Las Vegas in a single trip. There will be DevCon-only, AU-only, and AU+DevCon ticketing options available.Because the conference will now be held five months later, we have postponed the Call For Proposals and attendee registration.Last year, our first Forge DevCon offered two-days of the most up-to-date training, technologies, news, and insights around design, simulation, reality capture, AR, VR, and IoT. It was an indispensable experience for anyone working with the Forge platform. At this year's event you can expect more of the same. Only more so. Stay tuned for updates and please visit the Forge DevCon 2017 site to learn more. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us at forge.devcon@autodesk.com.We wanted to provide you with some additional information about this recent outage of the Forge Data Management and Model Derivative APIs.  These services began experiencing slowdowns around 8pm PST on Tues 12/6. The service degradation gradually worsened, until, by 1am PST Wed 12/7 we decided that it was necessary to take the service off line in order to take remedial action.The affected service was an internal system that controls access permissions to data in our storage layer. Without this service running, our Data Management and Model Derivative APIs were unable to store new data or access existing data. While addressing this issue, our priority was to take extreme care to ensure that no customer data was lost - even though this resulted in a longer resolution time.By approximately 1am PST Thurs 12/8 we had fixed the problem, restored access to customer data and started processing a backlog of transactions. We continue to monitor this service and are confident the code changes we made will prevent this problem from happening again. As a result of this incident, we have also identified areas where we can improve our internal processed and how we can better communicate with you when we are having problems.  One area we will be prioritizing is to enhance our API Health Dashboard to make it easier for you understand the health status of our APIs, and to receive more detailed information about any issues we are having.  The Forge Data Management and Model Derivative APIs are now back online, including access to data via the API for Fusion Team, A360 and BIM 360 Docs. The Forge team apologizes for this outage and any problems it has caused for you and your customers. We are now investigating all aspects of this outage to prevent it from happening in the future.The Forge Data Management and Model Derivative APIs are currently unavailable.  The Forge team apologizes for the current outage and any problems it has caused for you and your customers. Our team is working diligently on the problem and will fix it as soon as possible. The outage was caused by a problem in our service that controls secure access to data that is stored in our storage services. This impacts access to data via Forge Data Management API and the Model Derivative API.  This outage effects files created to view, translated to another format or for access to model meta data.  Access to data via the API for Fusion Team, A360 and BIM 360 Docs is also effected.  We will notify you as soon as the problem is fixed, and will follow up with information on what we are doing to prevent it from happening in the future.   The Forge TeamOur engineering team has now patched v2.10 and v2.11 of the viewer to address this issue. You may need to clear your browser cache, or if you store a local copy of the .js file you'll need to replace it with the newer version.Our development team has detected that, as of version 54, Chrome for Mac is failing to render 2D models loaded by the Forge Viewer. The problem occurs with all viewer versions up to and including version 2.11. Our engineering team are currently investigating the best way to fix this issue - either as a patch to v2.11 or in our next incremental release (v2.12).For your delight and delectation, below is a list of all currently planned events involving the Forge team. Obviously, we're planning new events all the time, so we'll try to keep you informed of new events by blog and twitter as we arrange them ...We briefly moved to a new default version of the viewer today (v2.11). However, after receiving several reports of 401 errors by people using the new version, we're reverting back to v2.10 while we investigate those reports. Sorry if this affected your application :-(.However, this provides a good opportunity to remind you again that we recommend you should always reference a specific viewer version from your production applications. This will prevent you being surprised by a new version of the viewer suddenly appearing in your application. A new version may have a changed UI or even a changed API. Versioning isn't required for your development and testing code of course, where you may prefer to always reference the newest version.To reference a specific viewer version, you should reference the viewer JavaScript and CSS files like this:Once again, we strongly recommend that you DO NOT use the unversioned URL in your production code (unless you like surprises :-)).If you’ve been thinking about developing on the Autodesk® Forge Platform, Autodesk’s new cloud platform, or on Autodesk® Fusion 360™—or, if you’re just curious about learning more about these technologies and what they could do to help your business or your career—join us for our upcoming free online hackathon.  This is our fourth online hackathon and you are welcome to participate in all or any part of it.The Autodesk® App Store Forge and Fusion 360® Hackathon is an online event which consists of two segments:We know that learning and implementing something new takes time and often gets put off so we’ve designed this event to give you the support you need - as well as a financial incentive - to motivate you to learn the APIs and publish your app on the Forge platform or on Fusion 360 in the Autodesk App Store. It will make taking action to publish apps simple and feasible. The training webinars will help familiarize you with the Forge platform and in the open Q&A sessions you’ll have the opportunity to receive help in real-time from the Autodesk team answering your questions to help you develop your app(s).

Students will explore the kelp forest ecosystem by conducting research and by writing imaginary narratives through an activity that integrates science and language arts.BACKGROUND Beautiful and biologically complex kelp plants grow underwater and create underwater kelp forests in the rocky coastline areas of the world�s oceans. They are a vital part of the kelp forest ecosystem, which provides food and shelter for diverse ocean species and is also a source of economic stability and recreation for fisherman and divers everywhere. Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) is a type of brown algae that can grow at depths of greater than 100 feet (30 meters). Anchored to the rocky ocean bottom with structures called holdfasts, kelp grows toward the sunlit surface of the water, held upright by gas-filled bladders at the base of the leaf-like blades. What looks like the stem of the kelp plant is called a stipe. As the blades reach the surface of the water, they spread out and float, creating a canopy. Because of this structure, kelp forest ecosystems provide multiple living spaces for the organisms that inhabit them. Ocean organisms can live up in the canopy, among the stipes, on the blades and in the holdfasts. The constant source of abundant food in this ecosystem enables these organisms to have their own niche in the food web, providing producers, consumers and decomposers with plenty of opportunity to feed. All organisms that live in the kelp forest need to be able to find food, reproduce, avoid being eaten and adjust to the changing physical environment. Today, one of the main concerns for kelp forests is maintaining a balanced ecosystem. Threats to the kelp forest ecosystem include sewage dumping, the overharvesting of kelp plants and overfishing. Studying kelp forest organisms will help students understand the role of biotic and abiotic factors that affect the kelp forest community, from sea otters to sea urchins, from abalone to crabs.The students will complete each of the eight sections by conducting Internet research or using the library to collect information.Be sure to pay careful attention to how the students include factual information about the kelp forest ecosystem and how their new species successfully lives in this habitat.ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Additional educator resources for Jean-Michel Cousteau: Ocean Adventurescan be found at www.pbs.org/oceanadventures.STANDARDS National Science Education Standards Grades 5�8 www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/6d.html#lsLife Science � Content Standard C: Regulation and behavior Populations and ecosystems Diversity and adaptations of organismsOcean Literacy: Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts coexploration.org/oceanliteracy/ Essential Principle #5: The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems.ABOUT THE AUTHOR Elsie Ovrahim is a middle school science teacher in Oakland and an independent contractor for KQED Education Network.

Is Amazon getting too good? We’ve been happy with Amazon Prime, especially the perks of membership like two day delivery, unlimited movies and music, even unlimited photo storage. If you’re going to pay for Amazon Prime membership, make sure you take advantage of all the included services.Unfortunately, over time we’ve started to see Amazon creep up as a higher percentage of our spending, showing up more frequently on our credit card bills. Usually just as a single line without much information about what we purchased or which Amazon service we purchased it from.We use Amazon to price check most purchases, especially any household staples that we have dropped off at our doorstep using Amazon Prime. I usually compare against Costco prices I’ve saved in Evernote or on Google Shopper so we’re not only getting better price on many items, I get to stay out of stores that give me hives. Staying out of stores is a good way to avoid impulse purchases. This was always a problem for my wife at Target, or myself at the hardware store. We’ve dialed back on impulse purchases over the years.The issue now with Amazon is that they’re making things too easy. They just started offering same-day delivery in our area on many items. They’ve gotten good at making recommendations based on our purchase history. I find myself jumping on the site to do a quick price check, or reordering a case of paper towels etc., and seeing something I remembered we could use.There are a lot of these lately. At first Amazon was great, we could quickly reorder household items and simultaneously check the price, online. Amazon would also save all of our purchases so we could go back and remember what kind of furnace filters we used. For example, furnace filters should be replaced every three months. Years ago I remember actually running to the Home Depot and buying three overpriced furnace filters whenever I needed to. By doing some research and ordering a case of these filters on Amazon, I save about 30 to 40% and can switch brands depending on what’s the best deal. I also saved myself a trip to Home Depot. How much is an hour of time worth? Think about that on your way to and from a store for a single item, make sure you include, time to park, gas wasted, time searching for the item, and standing in line to purchase it.All of this Amazon convenience started to create some issues. I remember needing to turn off one click ordering because occasionally I need to switch payment methods to order work-related items, especially since this often justified the $99 Amazon dues each year as a business expense. I realize there was also a psychological element to this. It’s important to put up some small barriers to help yourself avoid impulse purchases. So, instead of a one click purchase, items now just accumulate in my Amazon shopping cart, so I can do a batch purchase later instead of one-offs. The batch purchase gives you one last chance to get rid of a few items in that shopping cart. Almost like the old lady who didn’t bring enough cash to the grocery store. With a lot less hassle.As it turns out, creating some simple barriers to make your Amazon purchases less easy will save you more money in the long run and help you avoid impulse purchases.A lot of these barriers seem like an extra step, but once they’re set up, it’s automated and simply becomes part of your purchase and budgeting process. You’ll be surprised that that one last glance, asking yourself “why do we need this?”, will help you tame the Amazon beast and use it to your advantage.Filed Under: Live Lean Tagged With: financial independence, Frugal, Frugal living, frugality, live lean, saving money, Saving timeI am buying everything on amazon and most of the time i buy useless things which i don’t need , and i thing is a problem who needs to stop.I found its best to wait 24 hours after the urge to make an impulse purchase. For me it usually goes away.How to save on Amazon, Amazon, Amazon vs. Costco, saving money on Amazon

I always associated the idea of Amazonia as a very faraway place full of adventures, headhunting natives, starving missionaries, guerillas and wild animals. It was an inaccessible universe reserved for the most fearless that represented a risk to life.Taking advantage of living in Bolivia, I quickly became aware of the facilities, but tourists' tales disappointed me a little.Most of the travelers I met in La Paz had been in Rurrenabaque (Rurre) and easily found the jungle thanks to the tours available in this fast-growing city that is located at the gateway to the rainforest.In existence for barely 40 years, the city has developed with giant steps thanks to extensive tourism in the region. It seems that its history is strongly linked to Yossi Ghinsberg, an Israeli who was lost for three weeks in the Bolivian jungle in 1981.He survived without food, weapons and unaware of the dangers he was facing; he wrote about it in his book The Laws of the Jungle. It had an enormous influence on this small city that today is home to 17000 residents and more than 15000 visitors per year, mostly Israelis.The easiest and most popular way to visit the area is to go to an agency that will take groups of eight for 40 Euros apiece on a three-day tour, all inclusive, to get to know the wildlife hidden in Amazonia.At first, this type of tourist activity lead to some abuse to wild animals. Fortunately, creation of the famous Madidi Park National Reserve in 1995 and the less well-known, but no less interesting, Pilón Lajas Park (Reserva de la Biosfera y Tierra Comunitaria de Origen Pilón Lajas) in 1997, as well as other enterprises, have given rise to tourism that respects the environment and the aboriginal communities.Tourism in the region is used on behalf of conservation and maintenance of resources since Rurrenabaque would lose its attraction without its magnificent ecosystem.Today (2010), construction is underway on a highway and bridge (financed by the IDB) that will cross the city, disfiguring it and transforming it into a thoroughfare, which would undermine tourism in the area and benefit logging poachers. Town authorities are negotiating with the government to re-route this highway, but unfortunately initial talks were not positive. You can participate in this debate by signing the petition.Tourism is big business, and in Rurre everything is done to meet the visitor's needs. The Pampas Tour, for example, guarantees that you will see local species (freshwater dolphins, caimans, piranhas, capybaras, etc.). Thanks to the animals housed in the city's Santa Rosa Reserve due to chaqueo, (land clearing by burning), agricultural development and farming, tourists can see a large number of things in a short time. In the jungle it is more difficult to see the animals, which sometimes disappoints visitors. So, my idea of the virgin jungle that is hostile, full of extraordinary animals and plants was shattered because of such organized tourism. I was looking forward to the opportunity for an "authentic" experience in this area of Bolivia, but it no longer held a mystical attraction for me.After living in the Andes for a little over a year among the mountains, glacial, snow-covered peaks and crossing the Altiplano, I had the opportunity to go to Rurre, by-passing the travel agencies. Carlos, a neighbor on my floor, works in an office that supports community tourism development.It is impossible to develop projects on community land in Bolivia without the participation and authorization of community residents. Keeping this in mind, sustainable tourism in Bolivia means working together with the residents, which also means generating income for the communities so that they will not devote themselves to illegal activities, such as poaching game and fish or indiscriminate logging. There are already some community tourism initiatives (Chalalan, San miguel de Bala), and in view of their successes, it would be interesting to develop these types of projects.   Even though the communities are part of the tourist attraction, they do not benefit from it, only the private travel agencies, whose owners are usually foreigners.  There are three different ethnic groups in Beni: Mosetenes, Tsimanes and Tacanas. The latter are sedentary (settled in the territory for a long time and dedicated to agriculture and livestock production) with much influence from the Jesuits.The modern world has little influence on the Mosetenes and Tsimanes which have been settled for barely 30 years. They were originally hunters, living in small, hidden groups and obtaining their nourishment from the fruits of the forest. Nowadays, these communities are organized in groups of 35 families at the most, and they live in large, beautiful bamboo houses. They farm some corn, cassava, plantains, cacao, sugar cane, coconut, etc., and sell any surplus in the city. They do not raise livestock, but live by hunting and fishing.Since my friend has to make visits to some communities in order to organize roundtable discussions for his research, he asked us to go with him. Of course, we accepted enthusiastically.Sadly some mishaps interfered with our plans for the trip, but we finally settled on visiting three communities that are not far from the city (about 3 hours) and gave up on going to more distant communities (16 hours of travel) that are better preserved.The first community we visited was Asunción de Quiquibay (on the banks of the Quiquibay River), which has cabins for tourists that were built using Canadian aid, although they are now abandoned. It appears that the administration was not qualified, although showers and private baths were installed to improve service.We slept in the community's school and were surprised by the residents, especially the children who were very kind. They helped us get settled in and showed us how the electricity worked. It seems they do not attend school - at least not while we were there for several weekdays.In the afternoon, an old fellow gave us a tour and pointed out the sounds to hear in the jungle. We went down a path made for tourists several times that is full of cut trees, and on more than one occasion I felt lost.We collected coconuts in Asunción, although it was not easy. We were rewarded with the delicious, refreshing juice from the fruit that was perfect for the humid heat, which we also fought off by swimming in the Quiquibay River. Contrary to popular belief, piranhas live in lakes and not rivers, so if you take care, there is no danger.The second community we visited was Charque which is better developed even though it has only been in existence three years. There is more agricultural activity, and tourism is better run. An agreement with a tourist agency pays for the right to enter the community.Its school, for example, has joined with the national educational system, and the students (19 of all ages) attend every day. It is two years old and works perfectly: the students arrive on time and line up, sing the national anthem and quietly go to the classroom.The third community, Flores del Carmen, is reached by a two-hour walk (five minutes by car). The residents do not take part in tourism as a community; travel agents do not participate in community development. Thanks to its proximity to a city, it has basic services: drinking water, showers, baths, electricity and satellite dish.Overall, I did not find the people to be welcoming. Out of curiosity we boldly knocked on some doors to chat. Obviously one cannot create ties in three days, and I do not subscribe to the logic of wanting everything immediately, simulating spontaneity because of having paid.This trip was enriching and somewhat demystifying. I would love to have the opportunity to return to the Amazonian jungle (at a good time) in order to get to know the wildlife in the area better and in order to have closer contact with the people. TES001, Bolivia tourism, tourism Rurrenabaque, visit the Amazon jungle, Bolivia, Bolivia Amazon Rainforest

Washington, DC— Hydrogen is the most-abundant element in the universe. It’s also the simplest—sporting only a single electron in each atom. But that simplicity is deceptive, because there is still so much we have to learn about hydrogen.One of the biggest unknowns is its transformation under the extreme pressures and temperatures found in the interiors of giant planets, where it is squeezed until it becomes liquid metal, capable of conducting electricity. New work published in Physical Review Letters by Carnegie’s Alexander Goncharov and University of Edinburgh’s Stewart McWilliams measures the conditions under which hydrogen undergoes this transition in the lab and finds an intermediate state between gas and metal, which they’re calling “dark hydrogen.”On the surface of giant planets like Jupiter, hydrogen is a gas. But between this gaseous surface and the liquid metal hydrogen in the planet’s core lies a layer of dark hydrogen, according to findings gleaned from the team’s lab mimicry.Using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell to create the conditions likely to be found in gas giant planetary interiors, the team probed the physics of hydrogen under a range of pressures from 10,000 to 1.5 million times normal atmospheric pressure and up to 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.They discovered this unexpected intermediate phase, which does not reflect or transmit visible light, but does transmit infrared radiation, or heat.“This observation would explain how heat can easily escape from gas giant planets like Saturn,” explained Goncharov.They also found that this intermediate dark hydrogen is somewhat metallic, meaning it can conduct an electric current, albeit poorly. This means that it could play a role in the process by which churning metallic hydrogen in gas giant planetary cores produces a magnetic field around these bodies, in the same way that the motion of liquid iron in Earth’s core created and sustains our own magnetic field.“This dark hydrogen layer was unexpected and inconsistent with what modeling research had led us to believe about the change from hydrogen gas to metallic hydrogen inside of celestial objects,” Goncharov added.Caption: An illustration of the layer of dark hydrogen the team’s lab mimicry indicates would be found beneath the surface of gas giant planets like Jupiter, courtesy of Stewart McWilliams.This work was supported by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, the Army Research Office, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the Deep Carbon Observatory Instrumentation grant, the British Council Researcher Links programme, the DOE NNSA Carnegie/DOE Alliance Center, and the DOE EFRC for Energy Frontier Research in Extreme Environments.Carnegie Science, Independent scientific research, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science, Plant Science, Matter at Extreme States, Genetics and Developmental Biology, Global Ecology, Discovery, Essential Exception, Unconventional, Unconstrained, Small size, big impact, Investigator driven research, Entrepreneurial approach, Exceptional scientists, Internally funded research, Giant Magellan Telescope, Multidisciplinary scientific research, World class paradigm-shifting research, Cell division, Cell nucleus, Cholesterol, Cholesterol metabolism, Chromosome structure, Developmental biology, DNA, Egg production and development, Embryo development, Fat processing, flat fish, frog, fruit fly, Genetic engineering, Genetic Recombination, Lipids, Metamorphosis, mRNA, Nervous system development, Retinal cancer, RNA, Sexual reproduction, Stem cells, Worm, Yeast, Zebrafish, Alternative energy, Astrochemistry, Biomarkers, Diamonds, Earth science, Earth’s interior, Extraterrestrial life, Extreme pressures, Extremophiles, Ferroelectrics, First principles, High-pressure physics, Hydrogen, Hydrogen fuel, Storage, Hydrothermal vents, Life on Mars, Man-made diamonds, Materials science, Meteorites, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnology, Nitrogen cycling, Nitrogen pollution, Origins, Planet evolution, Planet interiors, Planetary exploration, Planetary science, Rise of Earth’s atmosphere, Solar system evolution, Superconductors, Airborne observatory, Amazon ecology, Biosphere II, Carbon cycle, Carbon cycling, Clear cutting, Climate change, Climate change and crop yields, Climate modeling, Desertification, Ecology, Ecosystems, Global climate change, Global warming, Invasive species, Logging in Amazon, Ocean acidification, Rainforest destruction, Remote sensing, Selective logging, Active galactic nuclei, Birth of the universe, Black holes, Cosmology, Dark energy, Dark matter, Distant galaxies, Early universe, Edwin Hubble, Extragalactic distance scale, Extremely large telescopes, Galaxy clusters, Galaxy collisions, Galaxy mergers, Gamma-ray bursts, Globular clusters, Hubble constant, Milky Way, Old galaxies, Origins, Quasars, Stars, Stellar evolution, Universe evolution, X-ray universe, Alternative energy sources, Arabidopsis thaliana, Biofuels, Bioinformatics, Crop improvement, Genetic engineering, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Maize, Nanosensors, Photosynthesis, Plant disease, Plant disease resistance, Plant genetics, Plant nutrients, Plant pest prevention, Seed development, Antarctic meteorites, Asteroids, Astrobiology, Beta Pictoris, Carnegie Caltech planet search, Comets, Continent formation, Core accretion, Dark Matter, Disk instability, Doppler velocity technique, Earthquakes, Exoplanets, Extrasolar planet atmospheres, Extrasolar planets, Extraterrestrial material, Geochronology, Interplanetary dust particles, M-31, Mars, Mercury, MESSENGER Mission to Mercury, Meteorites, Origin of life, Planet formation theory, Plate tectonics, Protoplanets, Search for life, Seismology, Stellar disks, Terrestrial planet formation, Volcanoes

There are no restrictions of the import and export of the country's currency and other currencies. Pre-Columbian objects are not allowed to be taken out of the country.1 - 6 Dezember: Quito - celebrations in Quito with many attractions, bullfights and many other attractionsPhotography we recommend normal films (200 ASA) for the highlands, the coast and the Galapagos Islands. For photography in the jungle we recommend films with about 400 ASA. It is also recommended to use a UV-filter. It is not allowed to take pictures of military objects and police stations. Please be sensitive when taking pictures of people. Please ask them kindly and explain why and for what reason you would like to take a picture.Conservation the beauty and the variety of the Galapagos Islands can only be protected if tourists follow the rules given by the National Park. These rules are the following:Money and money exchange It is recommended to exchange money in Ecuador, as the exchange rate is much better here than in Europe. You should take USD in cash with you or traveller cheques.The most common credit cards to pay with or to draw cash are American Express (Banco de Guayaquil), Euro/MasterCard (MasterCard Bank) and Visa (Banco de Guayaquil). In the cities you will be able to use your credit card in many places but when paying cash you can save up to 10%.Medical issues Unless you enter Ecuador from a country where yellow fever is a risk, vaccinations are not mandatory when entering Ecuador. However, we advice you to get the following vaccinations:Please contact your doctor or visit the nearest tropical diseases Institute to make all the necessary arrangements before coming to Ecuador.Indian Markets In the highlands are almost markets on a daily basis. Otavalo has the largest variety, but the others are definitely worth going to as well.Saturday: Otavalo (art, food, goods, animals), Riobamba (goods, art), Latacunga (Goods and bags made of Agave fabric)Sunday: Pujili, Machachi, Gualaceo (food and goods), Sangolqui (art), Cotocachi (leather works), Salasaca (textiles and jeans)Internet There are many Internet Cafes in Quito and in the other big cities in Ecuador. They charge you about 0.60 Dollar per hour. You can also use the Internet to make cheap phone calls to Europe or other parts of the world. Most of these Internet Cafes can be found in la Mariscal. In this area are also many bars.Literature South-American-Handbook (annually new edition) Ecuador and the Galapagos-Islands (Lonely-Planet) Ecuador& Galapagos-Handbook (Footprint) Climbing and Hiking in Ecuador (Bradt Publications) Background information Birds of Ecuador, Crespo Greenfield & Matheus, Ecuador 1990Nightlife As in any other city, the major cities of Ecuador offer a lot of nightlife with restaurants, bars and nightclubs to suit all tastes. Most of all you should you should get into the nightlife of Quito, which enchants its visitors with its special flair. Highly recommended are the following places in Quito: Café Sutra (cosy Café also to eat or enjoy a cocktail, Juan Leon Mera y Calama.), Zocalo (trendy bar, Juan Leon Mera y Calama) Encuentro (bar with nice atmosphere). No Bar (popular Nightclub with national and international music, good Caipirinha, Juan Leon Mera y Calama), Seseribó (Salsa-Night Club, Veintimilla y 12 de Octubre), Pobre Diablo (cosy bar, Isabel La catolica), La Bunga (night club, alternative, salsa and international music), Beerhouse (international music). Travel season and clothing to take The climate is suitable for travelling all year round. At the coast, the Oriente and the Galapagos Islands light and breathable clothing are recommended. When travelling to the highlands you should think about taking warmer clothes. A raincoat is always suitable. Those planning to do mountain-climbing need the special equipment which can also be hired in Quito.Safety Ecuador is a quite safe country to travel. Nevertheless you should not leave you valuables unguarded. Thefts are quite common, especially in places, which are frequently visited by tourists, such as the historic centre of Quito. It's best to carry your valuables in money-belts, which can be worn underneath your clothes. It is also recommended to join a group of other people when travelling alone.Language The language spoken in Ecuador is Spanish. Many indios of the highland are bilingual. They speak Spanish as well as Quechua. Indigenous people living in the rainforest speak their own languages and dialects.Beggars In front of the churches and sights you occasionally find old and disabled people, who get alms by the locals. In the major cities a lot of children are walking through the streets begging for money, children working as shoeshine-boys at the age of four or five are a common sight. In the end it is up to you if you give them money and how much. To give these kids an opportunity to earn money you can let them clean your shoes without needing to have a guilty conscience.Transport City buses and taxis in Quito are not expensive. In the front windows of the buses it is indicated where they go to. They stop when you wave your hand on almost all roads. It is possible to get off the bus at every time. A single ticket costs about 25 cent, no matter how far you want to go, as long as it is within the city centre. There are also a lot of taxis available. Taxis will stop on hand signal. During the day the price is based on taximeter, in the evening the price should be negotiated beforehand.Time difference The time difference compared to middle Europe is 6 hours in winter (Galápagos minus 7 hours) and 7 hours in summer (Galápagos minus 8 hours).Ecuador, Galapagos, Galapagos Islands, Travels, Travel, Cruises, Cruise,

Laut der Financial Times arbeitet der Onlinehandel amazon mit HTC an einem neuen Smartphone. Angeblich soll bisher an drei unterschiedlichen Versionen gearbeitet worden sein. Bisher ist allerdings noch unklar wie marktreif die Produkte sind und ob sie überhaupt jemals in Serie produziert werden. Nachdem amazon 2011 das Kindle Fire vorstellte und sich damit auf den Tablet Markt begab, wäre der Einstieg ins Smartphone Geschäft gar nicht abwegig. Auch ist HTC für Kooperationen bekannt, im April dieses Jahres erschien in Zusammenarbeit mit Facebook bereits das HTC First. Für HTC selbst wäre ein neuartiges Produkt sehr förderlich, da der Smartphone Gigant vor kurzem erstmalig einen Quartalsverlust verzeichnen musste.Das neue Flaggschiff im Smartphone Segment von Google, das Nexus 5, ist vor kurzem versehentlich im PlayStore aufgetaucht. Das Gerät wurde mit einem Preis von 350 Euro gelistet. Es wird vermutet, dass das Nexus 5 mit einem 5 Zoll Full HD Display und dem neuen Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 Prozessor ausgestattet wird. Dieser leistet viermal 2,3 GHz und wird auch im aktuellen Sony Xperia Z1 verbaut. Der Arbeitsspeicher soll 2 GB betragen. Wahlweise wird das Nexus 5 mit 16 GB oder 32 GB internem Speicher verfügbar sein. Die Kamera soll 8 Megapixel besitzen, vorne wird eine Frontkamera mit 1,3 Megapixeln verbaut. Des Weiteren unterstützt das neue Google Smartphone auch den aktuellen Mobilfunkstandard LTE sowie NFC. Der Preis für das Modell beträgt dabei 350 Euro (16 GB), bzw. 400 Euro (32 GB). Für die gebotene Leistung stellt sich das Nexus 5 also als ein echtes Schnäppchen dar. Der Erscheinungstermin des Smartphones ist allerdings weiterhin noch unklar. Sicher ist, dass es mit dem neuen Android Betriebssystem 4.4 alias KitKat ausgeliefert wird.Am 22.10.2013 steht die nächste Apple Keynote an. Wahrscheinlich werden ein neues iPad 5 und ein iPad mini der zweiten Generation vorgestellt. Des Weiteren werden neue Macs und aktuelle Infos bezüglich des kommenden Mac OSX Betriebssystems Mavericks erwartet. Das neue iPad soll mit dem aktuellen A7 Chip ausgestattet werden und zudem auch Touch ID erhalten. Wie beim iPhone 5s kann der Nutzer so sein Gerät per Fingerabdruck über den Homebutton entsperren. Das Design des neuen iPads wurde anscheinend überarbeitet und nun an die Optik des iPad mini angepasst. Weitere iPhone 5s Technik findet man bei der Kamera: auch im iPad 5 wurde die 8 Megapixel Linse mit Features wie z. B. der Zeitlupenfunktion bei 120fps verbaut.Das iPad mini der zweiten Generation soll ebenfalls vorgestellt werden. Wahrscheinlich wird es nun mit einem hochauflösenden Retina Display präsentiert. Für ausreichend Leistung soll auch hier der aktuelle A7 Chip sorgen. Bei beiden neuen iPad Modellen sollen die aktuellen Farben des iPhone 5s übernommen werden. Somit sollen auch iPads in z.B gold erhältlich sein.Gerüchtehalber soll das neuen iPhone 5c nicht so gefragt sein, wie man es von Apple Smartphones gewohnt ist. Vor kurzem gab der kalifornische Hersteller jedoch bekannt, dass die Verkaufszahlen der aktuellen iPhone Generation hervorragend seien. Wahrscheinlich trifft dies nur auf das iPhone 5s zu. SmartCheckerTV überrascht das nicht, denn unserer Meinung nach ist der Preisunterschied zur „günstigen“ Variante für die gebotene Leistung zu gering. Für 100 Euro Aufpreis erhält der Kunde ein iPhone 5s, welches mehr Funktionen und ein wertigeres Design bietet.© 2019 SmartChecker GmbH - Alle Rechte vorbehalten | Unternehmen | Presse | AGB | Datenschutz | ImpressumSmartphone von Amazon und HTC, Google Nexus 5, Apple Keynote, iPhone 5C nicht erfolgreich?

You may have seen doorbell camera videos of sloppy deliveries, deliverymen opening up packages, and those holiday season porch thieves stealing holiday deliveries.Christa Thomas never thought she'd be one of those unlucky homeowners, with a bad delivery experience, until now.Her security camera shows her husband almost running over a delivery, that was laying in the driveway. The Amazon package -- luckily containing just children's DVD's, and not a new iPhone -- was laying right in the "tire lane" of her driveway.      When the Thomas' checked their second security camera, they saw precisely how it happened. A delivery pulled up and tossed the package out his SUV's window like a newspaper."It shows the driver on our driveway, throwing the package from the window onto the middle of the driveway," Thomas said, "and then immediately leaving."A decade ago when you ordered from Amazon you could be assured that someone from FedEx, UPS, or the US Postal Service would bring that package to you.But now with tens of millions of packages delivered during the holiday season, anyone could be bringing that package to your door.These Amazon Flex drivers, as they are known, work for third-party companies, not Amazon. Then they contract with Amazon for the final leg of delivery.But Amazon told one of our sister stations earlier this year "we have high standards for delivery, and expect every package to be handled with care."Christa Thomas says they need to take a look. "It's highly concerning, had it been fragile and someone just throws it out the window like its trash, that's concerning."Thomas says if a gift is made of glass, or is fragile electronics, she'll probably buy it at the store in the future.That way you reduce your chance of a damaged package or missing gift, and you don't waste your money.Amazon Flex,damaged holiday gift, delivery, downtown, flex,damaged Amazon delivery,Amazon, driver, problem,region central cincinnati

Be sure to have a pocket full of dog treats when teaching your dog how to sit, stay, heel, or perform other similar commands. Make sure that the dog will find the CBD Dog treats in Columbus appetizing. Dried out, crummy, and bland CBD Pet treats will not make your dog want to train or whet his appetite and enthusiasm the same way a juicy piece of meat and sweet smelling cheese will.Dog treats have become popular grocery items found in shelves of specialty stores, pet stores, discount, and food stores. From expensive treats claiming prime beef cuts to discounted bulk products, cbd dog treats have so many varieties, similar to human treats.CBD Pet treats in Columbus can be hard and chewy since they are supposed to clean the dog’s teeth. Some dog treats are meant to aid in digestion and improve the internal health of the dog. Veterinarians have come up with varied dog treats incorporated with various medicines for heartworm prevention, antibiotics, and pain killers.Some dog owners make their own special dog treats. Homemade dog treats are either made from sliced pieces of steak, small bits of cooked hamburger, chunks of cheese, balls of rice, or even their own special recipes. These can either be CBD Pet Treats In Columbus. Some recipes even include molasses, wheat germ, and couscous. Owners should always check with a veterinarian before giving their pets these homemade treats. Remember never to give dogs chocolate not let them chew a chicken bone.CBD Pet Treats can either be vegetarian or made with meat and dairy. These can range from homemade dog biscuit recipes, cheesy dog biscuits, bacon flavored  CBD Dog Chews, multi grain dog biscuits, and microwave dog biscuits. Vegetarian treat recipes include vegetarian dog biscuits, vegan dog biscuit recipes, and doggie Christmas cookies.The ingredients list on the label is where the pet owner makes up his or her mind about whether they like what they read. Those who do or do not want to feed a certain ingredient can look to make sure it is included or excluded.Some prefer to say no to animal by-products, which may contain heads, feet, viscera and other animal parts not particularly appetizing, and from various species. But protein quality of by-products can actually be quite good, so that may not necessarily be the main bone of contention.Meat and animal derivatives - sounds tasty, doesn't it? This tends to be seen as an ingredient at the cheaper end of the pet food market, and as a source of protein. In the UK Meat and animal derivatives are legally defined in the Feeding Stuffs Regulations 2005. They are sourced from animals which have been inspected and passed as fit for human consumption and are the parts of the animal which are surplus to the requirements of the human food industry in the UK eg. heart, lung, or muscle meat, which may not be traditionally eaten by people in this country.Cereal by-products - Headlines such as 'May 4, 2007 -- Cereal Byproducts Company is announcing today that the FDA has determined that there are melamine and/or melamine derivatives in the rice protein concentrate produced by a single source Chinese supplier' do nothing to give confidence to consumers!Cereal by-products, a cheap source of carbohydrate and vegetable protein by their name and definition are 'by-products' of the human food industry, not usable for human food and could come via bakery/breakfast cereal or similar production. They will possibly be mixed sources of cereal, and may be lower grade than the straight cereals used in premium brands.Meat Meal is another ingredient that some pet owners don't like the sound of. By-products of the human food chain (carcases with some meat protein remaining) are rendered (heat processed), which removes the fat and water from the product. Meat or poultry meal can contain parts of animals not normally eaten by people. You probably don't want a detailed description (if you do try this one at Wikipedia!)Suffice to say, this is a huge business converting waste animal tissue into stable, value-added materials for several industries as well as for pet food.The article from Wikipedia interestingly points out that rendering is one of the oldest stablished recycling processes - taking what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering solves what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the US recycles more than 21 million metric tons annually of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, the U.S. industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.... food for thought, perhaps!The UK Pet Food Manufacturers Association (PFMA) states that it uses those parts of the carcass which are either surplus to human requirements or which are not normally consumed by people in the UK. Companies which are members of the PFMA operate their own quality assurance policies including strict specifications for material supplies, routine testing of all incoming materials and the use of vendor assurance schemes (and audits) to monitor their suppliers. The British pet food industry also uses sources of meat and meal from the UK, USA Canada, Australasia and various European countries. All materials imported must comply with the strict British legislation.UK manufacturers only use materials from animals which are generally accepted in the human food chain. They do not use horsemeat, whales or other sea mammals, kangaroos or a number of other species not eaten by humans. It does use beef, lamb, poultry, pork, fish, shellfish, rabbit and game. The PFMA practice of only using materials derived from animals passed as fit for human consumption is now incorporated into the Animal By-Products Order and PFMA member companies using animal material derived from the UK are recommended to only buy from and sell to companies registered under the Animal By-Products Order.When looking at an ingredient list, a pet owner also has to decide whether or not their pet has an intolerance to a cereal or protein type -this seems to be a growing problem.Some consumers try to avoid pet foods with synthetic preservatives, such asbutylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and ethoxyquin. Ethoxyquin, in particular, has been hotly debated. Current scientific data suggest that ethoxyquin is safe, but some pet owners avoid this additive because of a suspected link to liver damage and other health problems in dogs.Many products today are preserved with naturally occurring compounds, such as tocopherols (vitamin E) or vitamin C. However, these products generally have a shorter shelf life than those with synthetic preservatives, especially once a bag of food is opened.Comparing foods with different ingredients is difficult. Take protein content for example. Let's say we have two foods which have the same percentages of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and moisture. But one protein or carbohydrate type may be more digestible than another, so that complicates our comparison. For example:-Food A contains 25% protein that is 60% digestible and food B contains 25% protein that is 85% digestible. That means of food A the body is able to utilize 15% of the protein content, but of food B 21.25%. Logically, to meet the body's requirement of protein, you'd have to feed more of food A than of food B, and the body of the dog eating food B will have to work less to utilize it.Meats such as poultry, fish and pork all have a high digestibility, as do cereals such as rice and corn. Wheat, soya and oats are less digestible and logically therefore you would have to feed more to get the same nutritional benefits.Although manufacturers are happy to tell you that the meat they use is human grade and comes from the human food chain, let's be clear that this is not the best fillet steak or free range chicken breast. Meat producers make as much as possible producing for the human market, because it is more profitable- what is left is what you would probably not want to buy if it was put for sale in the butchers or supermarket!Cbd Oil Pet Treats Ebay Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsule Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Review Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Review Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Online Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Benefits Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Online Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Bottles Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Walmart Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Reviews Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats For Sale Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Reviews Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Reviews Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Uses Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Amazon Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Price Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Price Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Hair Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Plus Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Ingredients Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Treatment Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil For Hair Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Review Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Sale Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Online Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Prices Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Homemade Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats  Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Amazon Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats For Sale Columbus,  Cbd Pet Treats Ebay Columbus,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsules Columbus,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Gluten Free Columbus

The traditional embedded systems developer typically works at the bare metal level on disconnected devices, but the IoT requires systems to connect to the Internet. This requires embedded system developers to learn how to connect their devices and use a higher level operating system, such as a real-time operating system (RTOS).Rather than starting from scratch and learning every nuance required to securely connect an embedded system to the Internet, developers can use Amazon FreeRTOS. This will allow them to quickly and easily connect their devices to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a secure manner that simplifies their development efforts. This article will discuss and demonstrate how to get started with Amazon FreeRTOS.Amazon FreeRTOS is an RTOS that, at its core, is the open source FreeRTOS kernel with additional components added to enable local and cloud connectivity, security, and over-the-air (OTA) updates. The FreeRTOS kernel is a well-known RTOS that has been around for more than a decade and provides useful features such as:What makes Amazon FreeRTOS unique and interesting to embedded software developers is that it adds connectivity libraries and security to FreeRTOS. It then pulls it all together into a single cohesive framework that allows developers to immediately connect their device to cloud services in a secure manner out of the box.The FreeRTOS kernel itself works on several dozen different microcontroller architectures. At the moment, Amazon FreeRTOS has been fully tested and integrated onto four different microcontroller vendor hardware platforms through the Amazon FreeRTOS Qualification Program. These are:Figure 1: NXP Semiconductors’ LPC54018 IoT Module is based on an Arm® Cortex®-M4 180 MHz microcontroller with 128 Mbits of Macronix MX25L12835 Quad-SPI flash memory. A fully integrated Wi-Fi module to get a quick start with Amazon FreeRTOS. (Image source: NXP Semiconductors)Each of these development kits has been fully tested with Amazon FreeRTOS, but developers may have a preferred silicon vendor. For example, it is worth noting that Amazon FreeRTOS also supports OTA, but that support is currently only provided in beta testing for the Texas Instruments CC3220SF-LaunchXL (Figure 2). This board is based on an Arm® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller and features an onboard temperature sensor, accelerometer, three LEDs, and a programmable user button. This module provides a fully integrated solution to get started with Amazon FreeRTOS.In the future, the other boards will undoubtedly also be supported by OTA, but if this is a critical design feature right now, start with the Texas Instruments solution.Figure 2: Texas Instruments' CC3220SF-LaunchXL is a fully integrated solution to get started with Amazon FreeRTOS. It also supports the Amazon FreeRTOS OTA Beta demo example. (Image source: Texas Instruments)Most of the development kits are single module kits that are single board solutions. The Microchip Curiosity development kit, however, requires developers to purchase additional modules such as Ethernet, a Wi-Fi module, and a USB-to-UART converter.The board is based on a PIC32 microcontroller, but in order to get a fully functional board that can be used with Amazon FreeRTOS, a developer needs to purchase additional components. The best components to get in order to have a fully functional Amazon FreeRTOS example are the following MikroElektronika MIKROE expansion modules:The completely assembled board will then appear as shown in Figure 3. A developer would be ready to run the example Amazon RTOS application.Figure 3: Microchip Technology’s PIC32MZEF Curiosity Development Kit offers a modular design that allows developers to customize the components that they need for their application on their development kit. The image as shown also includes the MIKROE Wi-Fi and MIKROE USB to UART daughter boards. (Image source: Microchip Technology)Getting Amazon FreeRTOS up and running on any of the development kits discussed in the last section is easy. Each development board has a demonstration that is ready to go with step-by-step instructions on how to run that demonstration. For example, the Microchip board has instructions located here.Next, set up the hardware. For most development kits the hardware is all-inclusive, but if the Microchip solution is selected, each of the module boards needs to be added to the Curiosity board, and an external programming tool such as an ICD4 needs to be connected.Figure 4: The PIC32MZEF Curiosity Development Kit assembled and connected to an ICD4 programming tool. This setup uses a wired Ethernet connection to run the demonstration. (Image source: Amazon)Once the hardware has been set up, the next step is to install the development environment in which to compile the Amazon FreeRTOS example. For example, developers using Microchip would download MPLAB X, along with the XC32 compiler.In order to obtain access to the Amazon FreeRTOS examples, sign up for AWS and access their console. AWS does offer a 12-month free trial tier that allows developers to get access to AWS, Amazon FreeRTOS, and other features that would be useful for developing a connected device. Signing up for an account can be done here. Once the account is created, access the Amazon FreeRTOS page which will provide a list of software configurations for Amazon FreeRTOS. These configurations include source files for each development kit, as well as an Amazon FreeRTOS simulator. Download the predefined configuration that matches the development kit and import it into the development environment. For example, the corresponding Curiosity board would use the predefined “Connect to AWS IoT – Microchip configuration designed for the Curiosity PIC32MZEF.”Figure 5: The Amazon FreeRTOS software configuration page has several predefined software configurations for different development kits and different applications. Use these predefined configurations to get a demonstration application connected to AWS and jump start development. (Image source: Amazon)Once Amazon FreeRTOS has been downloaded, developers should return to their AWS console and click on the settings button. Under settings, they will discover that they have an IoT endpoint assigned to them such as:This important number allows the IoT device to connect to AWS. A developer would then find aws_clientcredential.h in the example project and set the following properties:At this point, a developer only needs to configure their device key. In order to generate a key, go to the AWS console and select Secure -> Certificates. There is an option to create a quick certificate. Clicking this option will generate a certificate similar to the one shown in Figure 6. The private key and the certificate are needed to generate a keys file for the embedded device.Figure 6: Creating a certificate and then a key requires developers to create their certificate from within AWS. The three files that will be created are a certificate, a public key and a private key. (Image source: Amazon)Using the certificate and private key files generated from the AWS console, developers can then generate their aws_clientcredential_key.h configuration file. Once this has been done, compile the project and deploy the software onto the embedded target.Figure 7: The certificate and private key that are generated in AWS are used to create the key configuration module that is loaded into the microcontroller and used to create a secure connection to AWS. (Image source: Amazon)The only remaining step is for a developer to subscribe to their devices’ MQTT messages. This can be done within AWS by going to the test menu and then subscribing to: freertos/demos/echoGetting up and running with FreeRTOS is simple and easy for even an entry level engineer. Despite its ease, there are several tips and tricks that developers should keep in mind when starting out with Amazon FreeRTOS. These include:The capabilities that are built into Amazon FreeRTOS can provide a way for embedded developers to easily connect their systems to the Internet. Amazon FreeRTOS itself is free, and developers can easily get started by purchasing a low-cost development kit and walking through the existing examples to determine whether or not Amazon FreeRTOS meets their design needs.Disclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and viewpoints expressed by the various authors and/or forum participants on this website do not necessarily reflect the opinions, beliefs, and viewpoints of Digi-Key Electronics or official policies of Digi-Key Electronics.Jacob Beningo is an embedded software consultant.

"Юлмарт" разрабатывает концепцию собственного маркетплейса и готовится отдать свои ресурсы сторонним продавцам.Таким образом, к концу 2018 года ассортимент торговой площадки увеличится с нынешних 75 тысяч наименований до миллиона, сообщает retailer.ru.Маркетплейс может быть запущен уже в следующем году, а пока что в "Юлмарт" трудятся над его концепцией. Предполагается, что ритейлер будет брать свою комиссию с каждой покупки, прошедшей через сайт магазина. Обрабатывать заявку и платеж также предполагается силами "Юлмарта", однако исполнение и доставка заказа будет лежать уже непосредственно на стороннем продавце.Генеральный директор "Юлмарта" Сергей Федоринов пока не спешит раскрывать информацию о будущем проекте. По его словам, компания не хочет банального повторения модели Amazon, а рассчитывает дать рынку что-то новое. В то же время он подчеркнул, что к потенциальным клиентам-продавцам у "Юлмарта" будут серьезные требования, так как сервис дорожит своей репутацией и не хочет жертвовать ею из-за продавцов, не соответствующих стандартам фирмы (например, возможности доставлять товар на следующий день).Еще одна b2b-составляющая, которая может появиться у "Юлмарта" уже в этом году, – это "магазин в магазине". Ее суть в том, что сторонние продавцы смогут открывать свои брендированные интернет-магазины прямо на страницах "Юлмарта". На данный момент в тестовом режиме работают субпроекты компании MicroXperts и Zifro, а также магазины вендоров, среди которых Apple, Braun, OralB, Lego. В этом случае все товары продавцов будут храниться в центрах выдачи заказов "Юлмарт" и доставляются службой компании.  "Юлмарт" далеко не первым предлагает рынку концепцию маркетплейса. Самым крупным игроком на данный момент здесь является "Яндекс.Маркет" и его 15,4 тысячи магазинов.Использует элементы маркетплейса и OZON. Директор по развитию бизнеса холдинга OZON Алексей Тимонин уверен, что создание маркетплейсов – это естественный процесс. По его мнению, пользователи заинтересованы в том, чтобы получить широкий ассортимент в одном месте, а не блуждать по разным ресурсам в поисках необходимых товаров. Для бизнеса же – это возможность получения дополнительной прибыль без существенных инвестиций в инфраструктуру и товар. Сейчас с ресурсом работает порядка 100 компаний, предлагающих 50-60 тысяч наименований продукции, то есть 10% всего ассортимента OZON.Элементы маркетплейса есть и у Wikimart. Только партнеров у сервиса шесть тысяч и предлагают они около половины всего ассортимента магазина. На комиссионные приходится около 20% всей выручки компании.Свой маркетплейс с июля тестирует и ритейлер Enter. Правда, участвует в этом тестировании лишь "Связной", который входит с Enter в одну ГК.Кстати, первая информация о том, что "Юлмарт" планирует запускать свой маркетплейс появилась еще в феврале этого года.Кстати, первая информация о том, что "Юлмарт" планирует запускать свой маркетплейс появилась еще в феврале этого года. Об этом в интервью oborot.ruнедавно рассказал директор по коммуникациям "Юлмарт Брайан Кин. Правда, тогда он затруднился назвать хотя бы приблизительные сроки реализации этого проекта, ограничившись лишь упоминанием того, что партнерские магазины смогут осущеставлять выдачу заказов в аутпостах и кибермаркетах "Юлмарта".Кин рассказал, что компания существенно нарастит свой ассортимент, в том числе и мебель, а также пообещал не ввязываться в сегмент высокой моды. Зато компания планирует нарастить свое присутствие на московском рынке, где, по мнению Кина, "Юлмарт" должен продавать в пять раз больше.Российские тенденции В 2015 году &quot;Юлмарт&quot; станет российским Amazon &quot;Юлмарт&quot; разрабатывает концепцию собственного маркетплейса и готовится отдать свои ресурсы сторонним продавцам.

VMware restored service and apologized for two outages last week that affected some users of its relatively new Cloud Foundry service.Those service disruptions don't compare in scale with the four-day outages experienced by Amazon Web Services customers, which concluded early last week. Amazon runs the largest cloud service, hosting some large Web infrastructure companies. The Cloud Foundry service, on the other hand, is only a few weeks old, is still in beta and had shorter disruptions.Cloud Foundry, introduced on April 12, is a cloud service that VMware is touting as the first open platform as a service, or PaaS. VMware offers its own hosted version of Cloud Foundry, aimed at letting developers build applications and run them on its service.The first Cloud Foundry outage occurred last Monday, on April 25, and lasted about 10 hours. Those most affected were new customers who received their credentials the previous evening, said VMware's Dekel Tankel in a blog post. The Monday outage was the result of all eight cloud controllers losing connectivity to a storage subsystem. The root cause was a "partial outage of a power supply in a storage cabinet which impacted access to a single LUN," Tankel noted.The next day's outage occurred when an engineer touched a keyboard, which caused a complete outage of the network infrastructure fronting Cloud Foundry, according to Tankel. It was Cloud Foundry's first compete outage. It lasted about 75 minutes."During this outage, all applications and system components continued to run," Tankel said. "However, with the front-end network down, we were the only ones that knew that the system was up. We take full responsibility for these issues and apologize to our users who were impacted by them. We can and will do better, having already learned from these incidents."Jeffrey Schwartz is editor of Redmond magazine and also covers cloud computing for Virtualization Review's Cloud Report.

È vietato l’utilizzo non trasparente, su siti e piattaforme di soggetti terzi, di parti complete o parziali del sito.Un gruppo di giovani, capeggiato da Renzo Avanzo, s’era in questi ultimi anni talmente invaghito delle isole Eolie, della caccia sottomarina e del cinema, da battezzare con il nome di un’Isola, Panaria, una loro piccola e intelligente casa editrice di documentari; e i primi saggi della «Panaria Film» furono naturalmente dedicati ad ardite riprese subacquee, nelle rade e negli stretti dell’arcipelago.Renzo Avanzo è cugino di Rossellini. Il celebre artista dà un’occhiata a quei filmetti; è colpito dalla selvaggia e per lui inedita bellezza di quelle Isole e lo assale la tentazione di inquadrarvi un suo film. Si reca a Vulcano, si reca a Stromboli, un nucleo di vicenda comincia a delinearsi, e dopo l’incontro di Rossellini con la Bergman, se ne annuncia il loro film, Stromboli.L’Avanzo si è nel frattempo accinto a definire un suo soggetto, pure ambientato in una di quelle isole, da lui per primo cinematograficamente intuite.Scoppia il cosiddetto scandalo Bergman. L’Avanzo si reca a Hollywood. Il suo soggetto piace, si potrebbe anche prestare a un enorme diversivo pubblicitario; ma perchè questo diversivo riesca al massimo, Vulcano dovrebbe avere per protagonista Anna Magnani.La Magnani firma il contratto; si firma la convenzione definitiva “Artisti Associati – Panaria”, e comincia allora quel singolare duello di produzione che vede al lavoro due troupes, contemporaneamente e a pochi chilometri di distanza.L’una a Stromboli, l’altra a Vulcano; di là la Bergman, di qua la Magnani; di là Rossellini, di qua Dieterle; di là un certo indugiarsi del quotidiano lavoro, di qua una volontà e una disciplina di ferro che non danno tregua a nessuno, anticipando più di una data, e portando alla conclusione per primo il film iniziatosi come secondo.Merito, questo, di Dieterle, un abile e tenace artigiano giunto alle affermazioni del Pasteur, dello Zola, di Lettere d’amore; merito della Magnani, prodigatasi con infaticabile fervore; e dell’Avanzo, conoscitore ottimo dei luoghi, bene attrezzato per riprese subacquee, e in quelle riprese, con Fosco Maraini, esperto e audace.E’ questa la triade alla quale si deve Vulcano: un film molto atteso, per motivi che soltanto in parte possono e potranno essere artistici.Ma è tempo di lasciare questa singolare guerra di dame, di registi e di film per venire a quanto lo schermo oggi effettivamente ci offre.L’inizio di Vulcano è quasi impeccabile. Con ampie e lente panoramiche lo sguardo indugia sulle Eolie, s’avvicina a una di esse, e con un motopeschereccio che fa da postale s’attracca a poche assi sdrucite, sulle quali scenderanno i pochi passeggeri attesi dagli abitanti del villaggio scesi dalla piccola rada.E’ una prostituta. Ha lasciato, anni prima, la sua piccola isola e ora vi ritorna, costrettavi da un foglio di via della polizia. Non può fare altro che salire l’erta desolata, verso quella che fu la sua casa.Questo inizio, ripeto, potrebbe essere il preludio a un grande film; anche perchè questa prima apparizione della Magnani è scabra e macerata, subito annuncia un destino greve di tristezza e di dolore.Invece, questo inizio, è il preludio a un grosso, abile film, parecchio congegnato, ben recitato, ma del quale è quasi sempre assente quel brivido di drammatica poesia che avrebbe dovuto trasfigurare la disperata vicenda di Maddalena, che giungerà poi al delitto pur di salvare la sorella minore dalla sorte abbietta che già fu ed è la sua.Dieterle s’è incontrato con un ambiente, con tutto un mondo, più che singolare: quello di queste isole vulcaniche.Data la rapidità aggressiva con la quale l’ha affrontato, bisogna riconoscere che ne ha sentito e quasi compreso fin troppo, ma non quanto sarebbe stato necessario per creare una sua opera d’arte.Tipi, scorci, luci sarebbero del nostro cosiddetto neo-realismo, direi del nostro neo-realismo più spinto; e ne è venuto un neo-realismo edulcorato, tutt’al più meticcio, o, se lo preferite, di esportazione.Il film ha comunque una sua forza, vibra per quell’ottima attrice che è la Magnani, trova altri validi accenti in Geraldine Brooks, ma sul film quasi sempre si stende una patina un po’ risaputa, un po’ d’artificio.Questa, per Dieterle, poteva essere un’avventura paragonabile a quella di Flaberty alle prese con l’isolotto e i pescatori d’Aran, ma il risultato è quello che è.Un film qua e là avvincente, a tratti ben cadenzato, con alcuni episodi notevoli, con parecchi squilibri di sceneggiatura, con qualche tratto gustoso; ma è il film che il regista Dieterle, con pari impegno e bravura, avrebbe potuto trarre, se comandatovi, tanto dai mari del nord come da quelli del sud.E noi, di fronte a certi ambienti tipicamente nostrani siamo per forza di cose diffidenti, difficili. Non ci mancherebbe altro, che i film italiani venissero in quattro e quattr’otto a farseli in Italia, i registi di Hollywood e dintorni.Anna Magnani, Ricordando Anna Magnani, Anna Magnani Biografia, Anna Magnani Filmografia, Anna Magnani Frasi, Frasi Anna Magnani, Magnani Anna, Anna Magnani Oscar, Anna Magnani Sito, Biografia Anna Magnani, Anna Magnani Film, Fotografie Anna Magnani, Anna Magnani DVD, Anna Magnani Video, Anna Magnani Foto, Anna Magnani Libri, Anna Magnani Curiosità, Video Anna Magnani, Amazon Anna Magnani, Luca Magnani Biografia, Anna Magnani YouTube, Anna Magnani Articoli, Vita Anna Magnani, Anna Magnani Morte, Anna Magnani film streaming, Anna Magnani streaming, Italian Cinema, Anna Magnani Roma, Anna Magnani La Lupa, Italian Actress, Magnani, Anna Magnani rughe, Anna Magnani Bellissima, Mamma Roma, Rai Anna Magnani, Interviste Anna Magnani, Anna Magnani Biography, Anna Magnani Filmography, Anna Magnani Theatre, Anna Magnani Photos, Anna Magnani Books, Anna Magnani Book, Anna Magnani Interview, Anna Magnani Curiosity, Nannarella
Months after joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, AWS announces its own managed Kubernetes container service.Amazon Web Services (AWS) made a long list of announcements on the first day of its re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on Nov. 29, including the long-awaited news that it will offer its own managed Kubernetes service.The new Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is a flavor of the Elastic Container Service (ECS) that Amazon has had in market since April 2015, when the service first became generally available. When AWS initially built ECS, Kubernetes was not a popular option, but times have changed, and AWS is changing along with them."This (EKS) makes running Kubernetes as a managed service on top of AWS much, much easier," Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, said during his keynote.Jassy said EKS is running the latest open-source version of Kubernetes and as such will be a familiar experience for existing Kubernetes users. From a deployment perspective, Jassy said EKS deploys Kubernetes master nodes across multiple AWS availability zones so there will not be any single point of failure. Automatic patching and upgraded are also part of Amazon EKS. Additionally, he noted that EKS is integrated with other AWS features."We're working hard with the CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation] and the community to make changes that will enable EKS to work well with all ECS services," Jassy said.With EKS, Jassy said users now have two container management systems they can choose: the new Kubernetes service and the existing ECS system. Going a step further, Jassy also announced a new serverless approach to deploying containers as well, which is where the new AWS Fargate service comes into play."AWS Fargate allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters," Jassy said. "It totally changes the way that you can run containers."Jassy said people want to be able to run containers at the task-level rather than at the server level. With Fargate, applications are packaged up into tasks, with the system automatically handling provisioning and auto-scaling.For those that still want or need to run more traditional types of virtual machines, AWS announced a series of new instance types.Among the new instance types announced by AWS are the I3 Bare Metal types that provide users with direct access to Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 processors, 512 GiB of memory, 36 hyperthreaded cores, and 15.2 TB of local, SSD-based NVME storage.AWS also announced the new H1 storage optimized instances for big data workloads with up to 16 TB of magnetic storage. Finally, AWS's EC2 General Purpose instances are also getting a boost with more compute power of up to 96 vCPUs and 384 GB of memory.Sean Michael Kerner is a senior editor at ServerWatch and InternetNews.com.

Be sure to have a pocket full of dog treats when teaching your dog how to sit, stay, heel, or perform other similar commands. Make sure that the dog will find the CBD Dog treats in Miami appetizing. Dried out, crummy, and bland CBD Pet treats will not make your dog want to train or whet his appetite and enthusiasm the same way a juicy piece of meat and sweet smelling cheese will.Dog treats have become popular grocery items found in shelves of specialty stores, pet stores, discount, and food stores. From expensive treats claiming prime beef cuts to discounted bulk products, cbd dog treats have so many varieties, similar to human treats.CBD Pet treats in Miami can be hard and chewy since they are supposed to clean the dog’s teeth. Some dog treats are meant to aid in digestion and improve the internal health of the dog. Veterinarians have come up with varied dog treats incorporated with various medicines for heartworm prevention, antibiotics, and pain killers.Some dog owners make their own special dog treats. Homemade dog treats are either made from sliced pieces of steak, small bits of cooked hamburger, chunks of cheese, balls of rice, or even their own special recipes. These can either be CBD Pet Treats In Miami. Some recipes even include molasses, wheat germ, and couscous. Owners should always check with a veterinarian before giving their pets these homemade treats. Remember never to give dogs chocolate not let them chew a chicken bone.CBD Pet Treats can either be vegetarian or made with meat and dairy. These can range from homemade dog biscuit recipes, cheesy dog biscuits, bacon flavored  CBD Dog Chews, multi grain dog biscuits, and microwave dog biscuits. Vegetarian treat recipes include vegetarian dog biscuits, vegan dog biscuit recipes, and doggie Christmas cookies.Finding the exact cause of itchy dog skin is going to take time as you sort out and eliminate various causes. In the meantime your furry friend wants some relief. Fortunately there is an abundance of commercial products available but even better there are a number of remedies that use products you may already have in your kitchen.For starters you can try to cure the itching from the inside out. Adding a tablespoon of olive oil to your dog's food will provide the omega-3 fatty acid that he needs to create the natural oil in his skin. Vitamin E is also essential to that process and you can get it in both capsule and liquid form.For treating the area directly, there is nothing more soothing than tea oil. Mix this with water and put it in a clean empty spray bottle and spray directly on the area affected. It's cooling and relieves the itching almost immediately. The downside is that it wears off after about 8 hours.Oatmeal is another great itch stopper. You can buy oatmeal shampoos but if you want to put a little work into it you can make your own. Take a cup of instant oatmeal (plain no fruit bits or artificial flavoring) and grind it into a fine powder in a coffee grinder. Mix that powder into a cup of water and stir. Fill the tub high enough so it will cover half the dog's body when he gets in. Work the oatmeal shampoo into his coat and let it stand for 20 minutes. Thoroughly rinse the pooch and pat dry with a towel. The oatmeal will take out the itch and actually calm the dog.Once you have your dog's itchy skin under control, keep up a regular schedule of grooming. Combing the coat encourages the production and distribution of the dog's natural oils and provides protection from future bouts of itchy skin.The bottom line is your poor puppy doesn't have to suffer. There are inexpensive treatments that will work miracles on itchy dog skin. Your dog looks to you as his first responder when it comes to dog health problems and you owe it to him to know how to take care his ailments.Cbd Oil Pet Treats Ebay Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsule Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Review Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Review Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Online Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Benefits Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Online Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Bottles Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Walmart Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Reviews Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats For Sale Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Reviews Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Reviews Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Uses Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Amazon Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Price Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Price Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Hair Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Plus Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Ingredients Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Treatment Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil For Hair Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Review Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Sale Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Online Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Prices Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Homemade Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats  Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Amazon Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats For Sale Miami,  Cbd Pet Treats Ebay Miami,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsules Miami,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Gluten Free Miami

In response to an article I wrote, Ernie Zelinski wrote the following comment. Since great comments sometimes go unnoticed, I decided to feature Ernie’s comments in this blog post . . .I have never used the term Amazon Bestseller or Amazon Best-Selling Author even though my How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free is often #1 in Amazon’s retirement planning category and has sold over 10,000 copies on Amazon in 2013 alone.Plain and simple a best-selling author is one who has written a best-selling book. In Canada, a book is deemed a bestseller if it has sold 5,000 copies. So, the Canadian Best-Selling Author term should not be used unless a Canadian author has a book that has sold over 5,000 copies.In the U.S., which has a population 10 times what Canada has, I would say that a best-selling book has to have sold over 50,000 copies. But, according to book expert Dan Poynter, a true best-seller is one that has sold at least 40,000 copies. I can accept that.Sadly, there are thousands of authors (and people claiming to be book experts) out there who say that they are a Best-Selling Author. In my opinion, these people are frauds.For instance, I recently came across a writer from my hometown who claimed the status of a best-selling author because of his book on leadership being an Amazon bestseller. Yet I know that his book has sold a mere total of 25 copies in normal book channels in the U.S. since his book was released in August 2011. The 25 copies sold include those sold on Amazon. (I have a subscription to the U.S. reporting agency that gives the weekly and yearly sales of print editions in normal U.S. book channels including Amazon and the box stores.) So if this guy is a bestselling author, then 99% of people who have books on Amazon are bestselling authors.Isn’t it about time that publishers and authors started showing some integrity by being impeccable with their word instead of using trickery and deceit to build themselves up?My advice to you as an author: Don’t use the term Best-Selling Author unless your book has sold 40,000 copies in the U.S. or 100,000 copies worldwide. If you start using the term when your book has sold only 25 copies or 100 copies or even 2,000 copies, deep down you will know that you are a fraud and lying to the outside world. Moreover, you will be telling yourself subconsciously that you are incapable of creating a true bestseller and have to use trickery or outright lying to claim that you are Best-Selling Author.For the record, I have three books that have each sold over 100,000 copies in their print editions. That is the threshold I personally use for what makes a true best-selling book. I have two other books, one that has sold over 80,000 copies and another that has sold just over 50,000 copies which I still don’t consider true bestsellers, even though Dan Poynter would say that they are.By using a much higher threshold, I am more motivated and inspired to sell a lot more copies of my books and attain much more success. That is one of the many reasons why I have sold more books (800,000 copies worldwide) than 99% of authors ever will.Ernie J.

Голосовой помощник Amazon – Alexa – на Рождестве отключился на несколько часов и лишил европейцев возможности заказать товары голосом, сообщает The Guardian.  Причина сбоя –   слишком большое количество пользователей, которые задавали вопросы или регистрировали свои новые устройства, полученные в подарок на праздник.Серверы Amazon в Европе оказались перегружены, поэтому Alexa отвечала на все запросы фразой "Извините, сейчас я не могу понять, о чем вы говорите". Пользователи в соцсетях активно сообщали о сбоях. "Alexa не подсоединяется к WiFi! Рождество испорчено, мой папа готов выбросить её в окно", – написала одна из них. "Хороший день для Alexa, чтобы сломаться", – прокомментировал другой пользователь.При получении голосовых команд Alexa отправляет их через устройство Amazon Echo на сервер, который обрабатывает запрос и передаёт команду Alexa. Голосовой помощник, в свою очередь, выполняет команду:  включает музыку, свет или делает покупку.Как сообщает The Information, в 2018 г. с помощью голосового помощника от Amazon покупки совершали лишь 2% пользователей. Около 90% клиентов, сделавших голосовую покупку, не совершают её снова. Зато около 20% пользователей используют Alexa, чтобы узнать статус заказов, сделанных при помощи других устройств. С начала  2018 г  Amazon продала более 50 млн устройств с Alexa. Издание предполагает, что пользователи не готовы покупать вещи при помощи голосовых команд.Однако, по прогнозу OC&C Strategy Consultants, объем продаж с помощью голосовых помощников к 2020 г. увеличится с $2 млрд до $40 млрд. RBC Capital Markets ожидает, что в 2020 г. Alexa будет генерировать от $5 до $6 млрд выручки благодаря голосовому шопингу.Международные тенденции Alexa: &quot;вас много, а я одна&quot; Голосовой помощник Amazon оказался перегружен запросами под Рождество и перестал работать
For taking another step into the Internet of Things, Amazon has acquired Denver-based startup, 2lemetry, which has developed an enterprise-focused platform to track and manage IP-enabled machines and other connected devices. The amount of the deal is still undisclosed.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch with a short statement, “I can confirm that Amazon has acquired 2lemetry and we look forward to continuing to support 2lemetry customers. Those customers include Honeywell, the Demeter energy group and First Mile, an office recycling service.Founded in 2011, 2lemetry provides a middleware and development layer for companies looking to connect device data with core enterprise decision making systems like CRM, supply chain management, quality assurance and service. In January 2015, the company had secured a $4 million round from Salesforce Ventures.Amazon had launched its Fire smartphone to fuel its e-commerce further, and since it has tried to expand its reach into offline commerce, this can be another area where 2lemetry’s technology would be useful.Amazon has made 49 acquisitions till date including the latest one and had invested in 28 companies including QwikCilver Solutions, Wikia, Yummy 77, Songza among others.Sujata is an engineering graduate and has done her Post Graduation in Human Resource Management.

ये हैं मैकेंजी बेजोस. साथ में हैं अमेजन के मालिक जैफ बेजोस. दोनों ने ट्विटर पर आधिकारिक तौर पर शादी के 25 सालों बाद अलग होने की सूचना दी है. माना जा रहा है कि इस तलाक के बाद मैकेंजी को जितना पैसा मिलेगा. उससे वो दुनिया की सबसे धनी महिला बन जाएंगी. मैकेंजी फिलहाल 48 साल की हैं.  माना जाता है कि अमेजन के विशाल अंपायर के पीछे जेफ की पत्नी मैकेंजी की भी काफी भूमिका रही है. शुरुआती सालों में ना केवल उन्होंने जैफ के साथ अमेजन की प्लानिंग और मार्केटिंग की योजना बनाने में साथ दिया बल्कि हमेशा उनके साथ मजबूती से खड़ी रहीं.मैंकेंजी और जैफ की पहली मुलाकात एक इंटरव्यू के दौरान न्यूयॉर्क में हुई थी. उस मुलाकात में जैफ उनका इंटरव्यू ले रहे थे और वो एक रिसर्चर के तौर पर नौकरी के लिए उनके सवालों का जवाब दे रही थीं. तब न्यूयॉर्क की एक फंड कंपनी डीई शॉ में जैफ वाइस प्रेसीडेंट थे. जब उन्हें नौकरी मिल गई तो उनके बैठने की जगह जैफ के केबिन के बगल में ही थी. उनका कहना है कि जैफ जितने जोरदार तरीके से हंसते थे, वो आवाज उन्हें भा गई. जल्दी ही दोनों ने लंच में साथ जाना शुरू कर दिया. तीन महीने बाद ही दोनों ने सगाई कर ली और इसके तीन महीने बाद शादी. विवाह 1993 में हुआ. तब जैफ 29 के थे और मैकेंजी 23 की.शादी के एक साल बाद ही जैफ ने अपनी शानदार नौकरी छोड़ दी और मैकेंजी को बताया कि वो अमेजन डॉट कॉम के नाम से ईशॉपिंग कंपनी शुरू करना चाहते हैं. मैकेंजी ने उन्हें आगे बढ़ने के लिए कहा. फिर दोनों अपने नए वैंचर का प्लान बनाने के लिए पूरे देश में घूमते रहे. जब अमेजन कंपनी की शुरुआत हुई तो मैकेंजी भी इसमें जैफ का हाथ बंटाने लगीं. धीरे धीरे अमेजन बड़ी होती गई. लेकिन इन सारे बरसों में लोग जैफ और मैकेंजी के कपल को एक मिसाल की तरह देखते थे.मैकेंजी का जन्म अमेरिका के एक मध्यमवर्गीय परिवार में हुआ. मां घर संभालती थीं और पिता फाइनेंशियल प्लानर थे. उन्होंने अंग्रेजी में अमेरिका की प्रिंसटन यूनिवर्सिटी में ग्रेजुएशन किया. हाल के सालों में उन्होंने दो नॉवेल लिखकर एक लेखिका के तौर पर नाम कमाया है. यूनिवर्सिटी के दिनों में उनकी क्रिएटिव राइटिंग टीचर और नोबल पुरस्कार अवार्ड टॉनी मॉरिसन कहती हैं कि वो उनकी बेस्ट स्टूडेंट थीं. इन दिनों मैकेंजी बाइस्टैंडर नाम से एक संस्था चलाती हैं, जिसमें वो एक्जीक्यूटिव डायरेक्टर हैं.ये उन दिनों की तस्वीर है, जब दोनों ने शादी करने के बाद अमेजन को शुरू किया था. जैफ हमेशा से मीडिया में अपनी पत्नी को स्मार्ट, रिसोर्सफुल, ब्रेनी और हॉट बताते रहे हैं. वो कहते हैं कि मेरी बीवी इतनी स्मार्ट है कि कई बार मैं उसको देखता ही रह जाता हूं. वैसे मैकेंजी की पसंदीदा पोशाक जींस और टीशर्ट है, जिसमें वो ज्यादातर नजर आती हैं.मैकेंजी और जैफ के चार बच्चे हैं. ट्विटर पर तलाक के बारे में उन्होंने लिखा है कि वो अलग हो रहे हैं लेकिन परिवार के रूप में बने रहेंगे. ब्लूमबर्ग का कहना है कि दुनिया के सबसे धनी शख्स जैफ बेजोस की संपत्ति को फिलहाल 137 बिलियन डॉलर आंका गया है. तलाक के बाद अगर दोनों का अलगाव हुआ तो दोनों में रकम आधी बंटेगी. इस हिसाब से मैकेंजी 69 बिलियन डॉलर की संपत्ति की मालकिन बन जाएंगी. यानि तब वो दुनिया की सबसे धनी महिला होंगी. फिलहाल दुनिया की सबसे धनी महिला लॉरेल ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स की मालिक फ्रांकोइस बेटेनकोर्ट मेयर्स हैं. उनके पास 45.6 बिलियन डॉलर की व्यक्तिगत संपत्ति है.AMAZON, MacKenzie S.

Jackson Award to the “The MESSENGER spacecraft flybys.” Director of Terrestrial Magnetism and principal investigator of the mission Sean Solomon will attend  the annual Goddard Memorial Dinner on 17 April to receive the award with Peter Bedini, project manager with The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, which manages the mission.The award recognizes the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging mission spacecraft, which was launched in August 2004, and has flown by Mercury twice. It  will fly by a third time in September 2009, and then orbit Mercury in March 2011 for one year to gather information on the density, magnetic fields, geological makeup, volatile materials, and take other measurements to better understand the structure and history of this terrestrial planet.Carnegie Science, Independent scientific research, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science, Plant Science, Matter at Extreme States, Genetics and Developmental Biology, Global Ecology, Discovery, Essential Exception, Unconventional, Unconstrained, Small size, big impact, Investigator driven research, Entrepreneurial approach, Exceptional scientists, Internally funded research, Giant Magellan Telescope, Multidisciplinary scientific research, World class paradigm-shifting research, Cell division, Cell nucleus, Cholesterol, Cholesterol metabolism, Chromosome structure, Developmental biology, DNA, Egg production and development, Embryo development, Fat processing, flat fish, frog, fruit fly, Genetic engineering, Genetic Recombination, Lipids, Metamorphosis, mRNA, Nervous system development, Retinal cancer, RNA, Sexual reproduction, Stem cells, Worm, Yeast, Zebrafish, Alternative energy, Astrochemistry, Biomarkers, Diamonds, Earth science, Earth’s interior, Extraterrestrial life, Extreme pressures, Extremophiles, Ferroelectrics, First principles, High-pressure physics, Hydrogen, Hydrogen fuel, Storage, Hydrothermal vents, Life on Mars, Man-made diamonds, Materials science, Meteorites, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnology, Nitrogen cycling, Nitrogen pollution, Origins, Planet evolution, Planet interiors, Planetary exploration, Planetary science, Rise of Earth’s atmosphere, Solar system evolution, Superconductors, Airborne observatory, Amazon ecology, Biosphere II, Carbon cycle, Carbon cycling, Clear cutting, Climate change, Climate change and crop yields, Climate modeling, Desertification, Ecology, Ecosystems, Global climate change, Global warming, Invasive species, Logging in Amazon, Ocean acidification, Rainforest destruction, Remote sensing, Selective logging, Active galactic nuclei, Birth of the universe, Black holes, Cosmology, Dark energy, Dark matter, Distant galaxies, Early universe, Edwin Hubble, Extragalactic distance scale, Extremely large telescopes, Galaxy clusters, Galaxy collisions, Galaxy mergers, Gamma-ray bursts, Globular clusters, Hubble constant, Milky Way, Old galaxies, Origins, Quasars, Stars, Stellar evolution, Universe evolution, X-ray universe, Alternative energy sources, Arabidopsis thaliana, Biofuels, Bioinformatics, Crop improvement, Genetic engineering, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Maize, Nanosensors, Photosynthesis, Plant disease, Plant disease resistance, Plant genetics, Plant nutrients, Plant pest prevention, Seed development, Antarctic meteorites, Asteroids, Astrobiology, Beta Pictoris, Carnegie Caltech planet search, Comets, Continent formation, Core accretion, Dark Matter, Disk instability, Doppler velocity technique, Earthquakes, Exoplanets, Extrasolar planet atmospheres, Extrasolar planets, Extraterrestrial material, Geochronology, Interplanetary dust particles, M-31, Mars, Mercury, MESSENGER Mission to Mercury, Meteorites, Origin of life, Planet formation theory, Plate tectonics, Protoplanets, Search for life, Seismology, Stellar disks, Terrestrial planet formation, Volcanoes

Amazon wants to open as many as 3,000 new cashierless stores in the next few years. The online retail giant wants to open 10 Amazon Go locations by the end of this year, 50 by the end of next year and 3,000 by 2021.   "What they are doing is trying to find the proper intersection between bricks and clicks,” says Darrin Duber-Smith, a marketing professor at Metropolitan State University Denver. “They have always been clicks, and now they are moving into bricks.”  Duber-Smith says in a time where physical stores are closing faster than we can click 'Add to Cart,' Amazon is redefining the retail space once again.  "The nature of shopping is changing as we speak, and Amazon is a part of driving that change and determining what that change looks like," Duber-Smith says.  These grab-and-go locations will have Amazon going head to head with convenience stores, fast-food chains and even the small mom and pop shops, Duber-Smith says.  3,000 stores may sound like a lot of Amazon Go locations, but compare that number to the 10,000 7-Eleven convenient stores in the U.S. and nearly 27,000 Subway shops and the 350,000 independently owned restaurants, you have to ask, will Amazon Go stores even make a dent?"It's not the number, it’s more the magnitude of having that Amazon brand now everywhere and not just online,” says Duber-Smith. “But it will become ubiquitous on the streets."  “The two companies are really positioned against each other, and it's kind of like Godzilla and King Kong, two Goliaths that are going at it."     retail stores, online shopping,Amazon, Amazon Go
The month of May is the official National Water Safety month, but as families head out for vacation these last few weeks of August, we thought to provide some key reminders. It seemed almost every month this summer there has been a news headline about an incident in the DC area where children have been saved from drowning or have died due to drowning. This issue is not isolated to the DC area, as noted in a World Health Organization fact sheet (updated May 2017), water safety and drowning are a global problem:Across the country and in the DC area, there are many non-profit groups that have resources available to raise awareness and increase preparedness. One such organization is CPR Party™, whose sole mission is to increase awareness and spread the knowledge for potentially lifesaving techniques.  In 2012, Laura Metro (Bethesda, MD) established CPR Party™ and is bringing CPR awareness and training to the masses.  This summer her efforts attracted National attention as she was featured on Good Morning America and Nightly News with Lester Holt:As shown in the video clip, the CPR Party™ event is a great way to get your friends together, gain some knowledge, and hone your CPR skills. Laura and CPR Party™ has made it easy to request an event through their website: CPR Party RequestOn the National scene USA Swimming is also making a big push to educate and equip children and adults alike with life saving skills. In 2004 the USA Swimming Foundation was established and “works to strengthen the sport by saving lives and building champions—in the pool and in life. Whether equipping our children with the life-saving skill of learn-to-swim through our Make a Splash initiative, or providing financial support to our heroes on the U.S. National Team”.  The Foundation directly funds the Make a Splash initiative which is driven to saving children’s lives through swim lessons. As stated on the Make a Splash website, their 3 main focus areas are:Also through their website, the Make a Splash program provides resources for parents to Find Swim Lessons within their area and take the first step to becoming safer around the water.Lastly, if you’re heading out the door or just arriving at your destination, spend a few minutes and have each of your family members Take the Safety Pledge. By taking the pledge, you are joining Olympians and others in taking action toward having a safe and enjoyable water experience!Thank you very much for the great work you are doing to sensitize and promote safe swimming programs sports, We are happy to write to you so that we can benefit from your advice, expertise , exchange programs, help and mentoring programs.

Vediamo adesso i migliori acquisti per chi vuole creare casa smart affidandosi all’assistente vocale Amazon Alexa, disponibile in Italia da poche settimane, ma già in grado di supportare una miriade di servizi ed accessori. Ecco i 10 migliori regali da fare a chi ha o vuole creare un sistema domotico con Amazon Alexa.Naturalmente, così come per Google, il punto di partenza è il cervello del sistema: l’assistente Alexa. Questo è già incluso in numerosi altoparlanti disponibili su Amazon, peraltro molto spesso a prezzi davvero scontati. Ed allora, ecco cosa acquistare per far felici i sostenitori di Alexa: partite certamente da uno degli altoparlanti disponibile.Il primo altoparlante che consigliamo è il dot di 3 generazione. E’ il modo più economico per iniziare a creare un sistema domotico con Alexa. Al momento è in offerta lampo e costa solo 29,99 euro. Si tratta di un piccolo altoparlante, paragonabile a Google Home Mini, che offre una buona qualità sonora, e che integra al suo interno Amazon Alexa: questo permetterà dunque di controllare a voce le periferiche connesse in casa. Si acquista su Amazon a 29,99 euro direttamente da qui.Altro altoparlante intelligente di cui vi consigliamo l’acquisto è Echo Plus. Si tratta del modello che per rapporto qualità/prezzo risulta probabilmente più conveniente. Al momento in offerta flash a 64 euro su Amazon, include ovviamente l’assistente vocale Alexa per il controllo domestico degli accessori connessi, ma propone una qualità sonora certamente superiore al modello Dot 3. Ovviamente sarà possibile ascoltare musica da tutti le principali piattaforme di streaming musicale, con Apple che ha già iniziato a supportare gli altoparlanti Amazon che riproducono anche musica da Apple Music. Costa 64,99 euro e si acquista da qui.L’offerta è ancor più ricca se acquistate il bundle Echo Plus più Philips Hue con due lampadine e Hub: solo 129,99 euro.Terzo altoparlante di cui consigliamo l’acquisto è il modello Spot. Non si tratta, in questo caso solo di un altoparlante, ma di un dispositivo che integra un piccolo display circolare. Questo permetterà di visionare informazioni su display, come il meteo, o di effettuare video chiamate con amici e familiari. Il prezzo è di 129,99 euro e si acquista direttamente da qui.Altro altoparlante con Amazon Alexa incorporato è Sonos One. Il prezzo sale leggermente, ma a beneficio della qualità sonora. E’ indicato a chi, senza voler rinunciare all’assistente vocale, vuole comunque un altoparlante di qualità, per godere di musica senza compromessi, grazie all’audi intenso e coinvolgente. Offre controlli touch sempre a portata di mano, resiste all’umidità e, dunque, ottimo per essere posizionato anche in bagno o in giardino. Peraltro, è possibile connettere due Sonos One per creare una coppia stereo, o aggiungerli come speaker posteriori per un audio surround home theater Sonos. Su Amazon costa 199,99 euro.Indispensabile per iniziare a creare un sistema domotico è la presa smart, da poter controllare attraverso smartphone, quindi anche in remoto, per accendere e spegnere i diversi elettrodomestici presenti in casa. Tra le migliori soluzioni per rapporto qualità prezzo consigliamo la ciabatta Koogeek 3, che risulta compatibile sia con Google Home, che con Amazon Alexa. Non solo propone tre diverse prese, ma anche tre USB Full Size, per ricaricare smartphone, tablet e altri dispositivi. Su Amazon costa al momento 59,99 euro.Non può esserci un domotica senza un sistema di illuminazione smart. Tra i più noti, e a dire il vero più funzionali, quello di Philips Hue, che vanta numerosissime soluzioni, con prezzi abbordabili, per trasformare l’impianto di illuminazione tradizionale in uno smart. E’ necessario partire da un kit base che comprenda l’Hub WiFi, una centralina senza la quale le singole luci non potranno funzionare. Il kit con Hub e due lampadine a luce calda bianche costa 79 euro su Amazon.C’è poi la possibilità di espandere il sistema grazie alle singole luci. Il consiglio è quello di puntare sulla Ambience, che permettono di cambiare tonalità di bianco, passando da caldo a freddo. Immancabile, per creare la giusta atmosfera, la lampada a colori.Una casa smart passa anche per una pulizia connessa. Da questo punto di vista l’aspirapolvere Neato utilizza l’App per Smartphone Android o iOS per avviare, fermare, programmare e ricevere notifiche relative alla pulizia domestica. Propone un sistema di navigazione Laser Smart SLAM che scansiona e mappa senza programmazione preventiva pavimenti e mobili.

Amazon is investigating allegations that some of its employees have offered to leak confidential information and delete negative product reviews in exchange for money.According to  a Wall Street Journal report  on Sunday, Amazon ( AMZN ) staff members are peddling internal data and other advantages that independent merchants can use to try to get higher rankings for their products in searches on the site. The practice is "particularly pronounced in China," the article said."We hold our employees to a high ethical standard and anyone in violation of our code faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties," she said.Brokers for Amazon employees in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen offered internal sales metrics and reviewer email addresses to independent sellers for payments of between $80 and $2,000, according to the Journal report. The brokers were also proposing to delete negative reviews and restore banned accounts, it said.Amazon has "sophisticated systems to restrict and audit access to information," the company spokeswoman said, adding that it would also punish sellers who break its rules."We have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them, including terminating their selling accounts, deleting reviews, withholding funds, and taking legal action," she said.The Journal reported that Amazon was investigating several incidents, including some involving employees in the United States.In 2015, the company  sued more than 1,000 people  who were "misleading Amazon's customers" by selling "fake reviews of products," according to a complaint. That lawsuit targeted account holders on Fiverr.com, a marketplace for odd-jobs where "gigs" are sold for $5 and up. Wall Street Journal Report, Amazon investigation, bribery, Fiverr.com,Amazon

Washington, D.C.— Life originated as a result of natural processes that exploited early Earth’s raw materials. Scientific models of life’s origins almost always look to minerals for such essential tasks as the synthesis of life’s molecular building blocks or the supply of metabolic energy. But this assumes that the mineral species found on Earth today are much the same as they were during Earth’s first 550 million years—the Hadean Eon—when life emerged. A new analysis of Hadean mineralogy challenges that assumption. It is published in American Journal of Science.Carnegie’s Robert Hazen compiled a list of every plausible mineral species on the Hadean Earth and concludes that no more than 420 different minerals—about 8 percent of the nearly 5,000 species found on Earth today—would have been present at or near Earth’s surface.“This is a consequence of the limited ways that minerals might have formed prior to 4 billion years ago,” Hazen explained. “Most of the 420 minerals of the Hadean Eon formed from magma—molten rock that slowly crystallized at or near Earth’s surface—as well as the alteration of those minerals when exposed to hot water.”By contrast, thousands of mineral species known today are the direct result of growth by living organisms, such as shells and bones, as well as life’s chemical byproducts, such as oxygen from photosynthesis. In addition, hundreds of other minerals that incorporate relatively rare elements such as lithium, beryllium, and molybdenum appear to have taken a billion years or more to first appear because it is difficult to concentrate these elements sufficiently to form new minerals. So those slow-forming minerals are also excluded from the time of life’s origins.“Fortunately for most origin-of-life models, the most commonly invoked minerals were present on early Earth,” Hazen said.For example, clay minerals—sometimes theorized by chemists to trigger interesting reactions—were certainly available. Sulfide minerals, including reactive iron and nickel varieties, were also widely available to catalyze organic reactions. However, borate and molybdate minerals, which are relatively rare even today, are unlikely to have occurred on the Hadean Earth and call into question origin models that rely on those mineral groups.Several questions remain unanswered and offer opportunities for further study of the paleomineralogy of the Hadean Eon. For example, the Hadean Eon differs from today in the frequent large impacts of asteroids and comets—thousands of collisions by objects with diameters from a mile up to 100 miles. Such impacts would have caused massive disruption of Earth’s crust, with extensive fracture zones that were filled with hot circulating water. Such hydrothermal areas could have created complex zones with many exotic minerals.This study also raises the question of how other planets and moons evolved mineralogically. Hazen suggests that Mars today may have progressed only as far as Earth’s Hadean Eon. As such, Mars may be limited to a similar suite of no more than about 400 different mineral species. Thanks to the Curiosity rover, we may soon know if that’s the case.Caption: The magnesium silicate forsterite was one of the most abundant minerals in the Hadean Eon, and it played a major role in Earth's near-surface processes. The green color of this mineral (which is also known as the semi-precious gemstone peridot, the birthstone of August) is caused by small amounts iron. The iron can react with seawater to promote chemical reactions that may have played a role in life's origins. Photo courtesy of Robert Downs, University of Arizona, Ruff Project.

Be sure to have a pocket full of dog treats when teaching your dog how to sit, stay, heel, or perform other similar commands. Make sure that the dog will find the CBD Dog treats in Washington appetizing. Dried out, crummy, and bland CBD Pet treats will not make your dog want to train or whet his appetite and enthusiasm the same way a juicy piece of meat and sweet smelling cheese will.Dog treats have become popular grocery items found in shelves of specialty stores, pet stores, discount, and food stores. From expensive treats claiming prime beef cuts to discounted bulk products, cbd dog treats have so many varieties, similar to human treats.CBD Pet treats in Washington can be hard and chewy since they are supposed to clean the dog’s teeth. Some dog treats are meant to aid in digestion and improve the internal health of the dog. Veterinarians have come up with varied dog treats incorporated with various medicines for heartworm prevention, antibiotics, and pain killers.Some dog owners make their own special dog treats. Homemade dog treats are either made from sliced pieces of steak, small bits of cooked hamburger, chunks of cheese, balls of rice, or even their own special recipes. These can either be CBD Pet Treats In Washington. Some recipes even include molasses, wheat germ, and couscous. Owners should always check with a veterinarian before giving their pets these homemade treats. Remember never to give dogs chocolate not let them chew a chicken bone.CBD Pet Treats can either be vegetarian or made with meat and dairy. These can range from homemade dog biscuit recipes, cheesy dog biscuits, bacon flavored  CBD Dog Chews, multi grain dog biscuits, and microwave dog biscuits. Vegetarian treat recipes include vegetarian dog biscuits, vegan dog biscuit recipes, and doggie Christmas cookies.Many people think that a dog treat is just a treat, but many don't realize nutritional harm or good, some of these treats offer. Ideally, a healthy treat should contain a variety of naturally occurring nutrients, and not a lot of empty ingredients or, low quality vitamins and minerals, often added as supplements to conventional pet foods and treats. Learn about the benefits of using organic dog treats and give your pet good health and yourself, peace of mind.The food you feed your dog is the single most important factor affecting his or her health. Organic dog treats provide more than merely calories for your dog. Aside from energy, healthy treats should provide an appropriate amount of protein, fats, carbohydrates, and nutrients. The quality of the ingredients used in a given pet food, determines how much nutrition your dog receives. The healthiest ingredients are often labeled USDA certified organic. These foods contain much higher levels of nutrients, such as vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals, than non-certified organic or conventional ingredients. Foods which contain organic ingredients supply your dog with nutrients that are important for both, maintenance of health and proper healing after injuries.It is a fact that USDA certified organic ingredients contain significantly lower amounts of pesticide residues, as well as other potentially toxic chemicals, which sometimes accumulate during their production. Another reason the healthiest dog treats are USDA certified organic, is that organic regulations prohibit the use of ingredients that cannot be traced to their source, or those that were genetically modified. Organic certification excludes the use of inferior or questionable ingredients, such as by-products, as well as the use of potentially toxic synthetic ingredients.A truly healthy dog treat should contain certified organic ingredients. This assures that the quality of the ingredients are good and free of hormones and antibiotics. The best dog treats should contain only those animal-derived ingredients from animals that were humanely raised and grown. This assures that the animal components used are free of external toxins or hormones released during a stressful life on a manufacturing farm or just prior to slaughter, either of which can negatively impact your pet's health.Like most organic products, organic dog treats may cost a little more than the average treat. However, organic treats are much healthier and well worth the extra cost.Cbd Oil Pet Treats Ebay Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsule Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Review Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Review Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Online Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Benefits Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Online Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Bottles Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Walmart Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Reviews Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats For Sale Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Reviews Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Reviews Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Uses Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Amazon Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Price Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Price Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Hair Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Plus Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Ingredients Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Treatment Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil For Hair Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Review Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Sale Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Online Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Prices Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Homemade Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats  Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Amazon Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats For Sale Washington,  Cbd Pet Treats Ebay Washington,  Cbd Pet Oil Capsules Washington,  Cbd Oil Pet Treats Gluten Free Washington

Pasadena, CA— A team of astronomers from three institutions has developed a new type of telescope camera that makes higher resolution images than ever before, the culmination of 20 years of effort. The team has been developing this technology at telescope observatories in Arizona and now has deployed the latest version of these cameras in the high desert of Chile at the Magellan 6.5m (21 foot) telescope. Carnegie’s Alan Uomoto and Tyson Hare, joined by a team of researchers from the University of Arizona and Arcetri Observatory in Italy, will publish three papers containing the highest-resolution images ever taken, as well as observations that answer questions about planetary formation, in The Astrophysical Journal.“It was very exciting to see this new camera make the night sky look sharper than has ever before been possible” said Laird Close of the University of Arizona, who was the project’s principal scientist. “We, for the first time, can make deep images that resolve objects just 0.02 arcseconds across—this is a very small angle—it is like resolving the width of a dime seen from 100 miles away, or like resolving a convoy of three school busses driving together on the surface of the Moon.”This improvement results from the use of a large 6.5m telescope for photography at its theoretical resolution limit for wavelengths of visible light. Previously, large telescopes could make sharp photos only in infrared (long wavelength) light. Even large telescopes, those equipped with complex adaptive optics imaging cameras, could only make blurry images in visible light. The new camera can work in the visible spectrum and can make high-resolution photos, because as the resolution moves towards bluer wavelengths, the image sharpness improves.To correct for atmospheric turbulence, the team developed a very powerful adaptive optics system that floats a thin (1.6 mm –1/16 of inch thick) curved glass mirror (85 cm across) on a magnetic field 9.2m above the big primary mirror of the telescope. This, so-called Adaptive Secondary Mirror (ASM) can change its shape at 585 points on its surface 1000 times a second. In this manner the “blurring” effects of the atmosphere can be removed, and thanks to the high density of actuators on this mirror, astronomers can see the visible sky more clearly than ever before.“The Magellan community is delighted to have this powerful new capability, a final addition to our current instrument suite,” said Wendy Freedman, director of the Carnegie Observatories. “It also represents a significant technical milestone for the Giant Magellan Telescope.”The new adaptive optics system, called MagAO, has already made some important scientific discoveries. As the system was being tested, the team tried to resolve the famous star that gives the Great Orion Nebulae most of its UV light. This 1 million-year-old star is called Theta 1 Ori C and it is about 44 times the mass of the Sun. It was already known to be a binary star (two stars rotating around each other); however, the separation between them is so small that this famous pair has never been resolved into two stars in a direct telescope photo. Once MagAO and VisAO (its visible-light camera) were pointed towards Theta Ori 1 C, the results were exciting and immediate.The team also mapped out all the positions of the brightest nearby cluster stars and was able to detect very small motions as the stars slowly revolved around each other. Indeed a small group of five stars called Theta 1 Ori B was is likely a bound “mini-cluster” of stars, one that may eject the lowest mass star of the five in the near future.The team also managed to address a longstanding question about how planets form. Scientists have long wondered whether the disks of gas and dust that surround a protoplanet are affected by the strong ionizing light and wind coming from a massive star, one like Theta 1 Ori C. The team used MagAO and VisAO to look for red light from ionized hydrogen gas to trace how the strong UV light and wind from Theta 1 Ori C affects the disks around its neighboring stars. MagAO’s photo shows that a pair of stars some 7 arcseconds away from Theta 1 Ori C was heavily distorted into “teardrop” shapes as the strong UV light and wind create shock fronts and drag gas downwind of the star, a very rare example of a low mass pair of young disks.Another mystery about planetary formation is how the dust and gas are redistributed in a young disk. The team used VisAO’s special simultaneous/spectral differential imager (SDI) to image one of the rare “silhouette” disks in Orion. The disk is in front of the M42 nebula and so the astronomers could see the dark shadow cast as the dust in the disk absorbed the background light of the nebula. The SDI camera allowed the light from the star to be removed at a very high level, leaving, for the first time, a clear look at the silhouette, demonstrating that MagAO can make visible images of even very faint stars.Caption: The Magellan Telescope with MagAO’s Adaptive Secondary Mirror (ASM) mounted at the top looking down on the 6.5m (21 foot) diameter Primary Mirror.

The Magellan telescopes are run by a partnership of the Carnegie Institution for Science, University of Arizona, Harvard University, MIT, and the University of Michigan.  A MagAO image of Orion 218-354 silhouette after removal of light from the central star. The left-hand image shows the silhouette (shadow) of the disk against the bright background hydrogen alpha emission of the Orion nebula. The right-hand image is the same, but with contours denoting levels of increasing attenuation of the background nebular light toward the central star. The percentages denote the amount of nebular light passing through the disk. The degree of attenuation probes the amount of dust in the disk at each location.

Here we show (on the left) a “normal”photo of the theta 1 Ori C binary star in red light (in the r’ filter, 630 nm). It just looks an unresolved star. Then the middle image shows how if we remove (in real time) the blurring of the atmosphere with MagAO’s adaptive optics’ the resulting photo becomes ~17 times sharper (corrected resolutions range from 0.019-0.029 arcseconds on theta 1 Ori C). Both photos are 60 seconds long, and no post-detection image enhancement has been applied.These are the highest resolution photos taken by a telescope.

The top inset image shows MagAO’s photo of the “mini-cluster” of young stars in the Theta 1 OriB group (B1-B4; Top Inset image). There is now clear evidence of relative motion of these stars around B1. The lowest mass member (B4) will likely be ejected in the future.

Challenge Labs do not provide the "cookbook" steps, but require solutions to be built with minimal guidance, across many GCP technologies. All labs have activity tracking and in order to earn this badge you must score 100% in each lab. This quest is not easy and will put your GCP technology skills to the test. Be aware that while practice with these labs will increase your knowledge and abilities, we recommend additional study, experience, and background in cloud architecture to prepare for this certification.This Quest of hands-on labs demonstrates the power of integrating Google Cloud Platform services and tools with G Suite applications. With integration technologies such as App Script and the Clasp Command Line environment, you will create and publish web apps and add-ons for G Suite products: Sheets, Docs, Forms, and Slides. With App Maker you will build a ready-to-use app that has a Google Cloud SQL Database, Google Maps integration, and a Mobile Responsive Design. Other labs create direct connections to GCP data sources-- using the BigQuery API, Sheets, and Slides to collect, analyze and present data.Networking is a principle theme of cloud computing—it’s the underlying structure of GCP and it’s what connects all your resources and services to one another. This fundamental-level quest will cover essential GCP networking services and will give you hands-on practice with specialized tools for developing mature networks. From learning the ins-and-outs of VPCs, to creating enterprise-grade load balancers, Networking in the Google Cloud will give you the practical experience needed so you can start building robust networks right away.This lab provides the basic hands-on experience of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling -- setting up Auto Scaling to automatically launch compute instances in response to conditions that you specify. You will use Auto Scaling via the AWS console to create the basic infrastructure of a Launch Configuration and an Auto Scaling group. You will test the configuration by terminating a running instance and viewing the results as Auto Scaling responds by scaling up and starting another instance. For the lab to function as written, please DO NOT change the auto assigned region.This lab demonstrates how to launch an Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) cluster for Big Data processing and use Hive with SQL-style queries to analyze data. You will create a Hadoop cluster using Amazon EMR which will allow to run interactive Hive queries against data stored in Amazon S3. You will use Hive to normalize the data in a more useful way, and you will run queries to analyze the data.This lab demonstrates how to use an Amazon S3 bucket and manage files, or object, that are stored in the bucket. You will practice how to create a bucket, add an object, view an object, move an object, and delete an object and bucket in the AWS Management Console.This lab will demonstrate how to create an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network using AWS CloudFormation. Note: This lab is a more of a walkthrough of a template rather than "learn how to build it". You will walk through the sections of an AWS CloudFormation template and get explanations for each step. You will then launch the AWS CloudFormation template to create a four-subnet Amazon VPC that spans two Availability Zones and a NAT that allows servers in the private subnets to communicate with the Internet in order to download packages and updates.In this lab, you create one VM in the premium network service tier (default) and one VM in the standard network service tier. Then you compare the latency and routes for each VM instance.In this lab you'll take audio from the client's microphone and stream it to a Java servlet. The Java servlet passes the data to the Cloud Speech API, which then streams transcriptions back to the servlet.In this lab, you configure a network to record traffic to and from an apache web server using VPC Flow Logs. You then export the logs to BigQuery to analyze them.In this lab, you will build a Google Assistant app with Dialogflow, Cloud Functions, and the Google News API to generate the top headlines and breaking news on topics and categories users desire.In this lab, you will utilize the AWS Elemental MediaConvert Service to convert input video into multiple output formats, combine multiple videos into one during the conversion process, add captions/watermarks to the videos, and work with ad insertion metadata.In this lab you will learn how to leverage Apigee to transparently migrate application traffic from legacy backends to GCP-backed systems.Hands-On Labs, GCP Training, Google Cloud Platform Training, Google Hands-On Labs, Google Cloud Certification, AWS Training, AWS Certification Prep, Amazon Web Services Labs

I'm trying to focus on the core virtualization and supporting technologies here in San Francisco. Generally speaking, Mondays and Thursdays are days where you can try to squeeze in other things. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are very content-heavy days. There were a few sessions that I took in today outside from the base set of virtualization.One of the events I attended was about the new Nimbula Director. As it exists today, Nimbula is based on the KVM hypervisor and is a hybrid cloud solution. This is ironic, at face value, as the founders worked on the team that developed the Amazon EC2 cloud. The hypervisor base will expand, but that isn't really too important. Nimbula Director is a hybrid cloud solution that presents a management dashboard that can manage an internal cloud and public clouds such as Amazon EC2 servers running as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Hybrid cloud architecture is an emerging science, of sorts, but what stood out to me is Nimbula's approach to permissions and policies. Frequently, many off-the-shelf solutions have products that don't allow the security policy to supersede the permissions model. In the VMware world, there are solutions like HyTrust that can allow this to happen. Nimbula is on the right course in taking the totally fresh perspective to the permission model and infrastructure policies.Another session I attended was on extreme scale out with the HP Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD). The HP POD is effectively a small datacenter contained in either a 20- or 40-foot-long box. This box was initially built into industry standard shipping containers for the generation one (G1) pod, but the generation three (G3) pod is slightly modified from the traditional shipping container to allow for better airflow management, access and accommodate additional length. In this box, there can be up to 22 racks that are fully controlled, monitored and managed through HP technologies. There is a professional services component for this product, but the capacity on demand is mind-boggling. In a typical fully populated POD, there can be capacity for up to a half-million virtual machines. The underlying technologies of the POD include MDS storage, which doesn't put hard drives facing the front bus. The drives are installed along the depth dimension and are on slide-out trays to increase density. The server solution is the ProLiant SL series. Customers can get partially populated PODs or mix other vendor hardware. Overall, getting my head around extreme scale is exciting but can be tough to fit outside of the traditional datacenter.As VMworld switches into high gear this week, be sure to follow my Tweets at @RickVanover for notes of what is going on, photos and video from my journey. If you are at the event, track me down or just start shouting "Hey Now," and say hello.VMworld, Nimbula Director, HyTrust, Amazon Machine Images, HP Performance Optimized Datacenter

Traditionally, the archaeologists have the vast Amazon region of South America to be a cultural backwater compared to the better-known civilizations that developed in the Americas. Scholars stress the limitations of tropical environments and lack of critical technological innovations to sustain civilizations. In recent years, the documentation of intensive agriculture, black earth, managed forests, hydraulic engineering, and large settlements has questioned traditional assumptions. Dr. Erickson has documented fascinating monumental earthworks called geoglyphs, ring ditches, or geometric enclosures that cover several acres to nearly a square mile. The geometric patterns suggest a concern for landscape design, high visibility, and aesthetics. Deep ditches imply that huge volumes of earth moved. Various hypotheses are presented for the functions of earthworks. The existence of earthworks of such magnitude and density throughout Western Amazonia shows the ability of native peoples to transform their landscapes at a massive scale.University Of Pennsylvania Museum Of Archaeology And Anthropology (Museum), Penn Museum, Phildelphia Museum, Philadelphia Museums, Amazon, Amazon Rainforest ...
