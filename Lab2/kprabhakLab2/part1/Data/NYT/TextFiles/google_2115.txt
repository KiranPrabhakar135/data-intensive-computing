india fights diabetic blindness help aimadurai india — aravind eye hospital treat anyone comes door without moneyeach day  people arrive across india sometimes parts world crowding hallways waiting rooms yearold hospital southern end country recent morning vt muthusamy ramalingamm local resident walked room second floor sat rested chin small desktop device pointed camera eyesa technician tapped screen back eye scanner within seconds diagnosis appeared computer wall eyes showed signs diabetic retinopathy condition cause blindness untreatedin hospitals clinics around world trained physicians make diagnosis examining patient’s eyes identifying tiny lesions hemorrhages discoloration anticipate diabetic blindness aravind trying automate process working team google artificial intelligence researchers based california hospital testing system recognize condition owngoogle sister company verily targeted type blindness prevalence sort illness ai system detect early google charging hospital tests technologyresearchers hope ai system help doctors screen patients country diabetic retinopathy increasingly prevalent nearly million indians diabetic according world health organization risk blindness country train enough doctors properly screen all every one million people india eye doctors according international council ophthalmologythe project part widespread effort build deploy systems automatically detect signs illness disease medical scans hospitals united states britain singapore also run clinical trials systems detect signs diabetic blindness researchers across globe exploring technologies detect cancer stroke heart disease conditions xrays mri ct scanslast month regulators certified eye system use europe verily name food drug administration recently approved similar system united states hospitals treading lightly consider deploying systems vastly different technology traditionally used health carearavind’s founder govindappa venkataswamy iconic figure india known “dr v” died  envisioned network hospitals vision centers operate like mcdonald’s franchises systematically reproducing inexpensive forms eye care people across country vision centers around indiain addition screening patients madurai — one largest cities southern india — hospital plans install google’s technology surrounding villages eye doctors available new ai system could radically expand number people screened“right now bottleneck comes screening patients ” said dr r kim nephew dr v’s serves chief medical officer aravindbehind new screening methods neural networks complex mathematical systems learn tasks analyzing vast amounts data analyzing millions retinal scans showing signs diabetic blindness neural network learn identify condition owna neural network technology rapidly improving face recognition services talking digital assistants driverless cars instant translation services like google translatebecause systems learn enormous amounts information researchers still struggling completely understand work — ultimately behave experts believe honed tested properly deployed fundamentally improve health careat aravind computer screens mounted walls waiting rooms translate information myriad languages spoken hospitalduring exam mr ramalingamm  spoke tamil ancient language southern india sri lanka said comfortable machine diagnosing eye condition part happened quickly initial screening ai system doctors could treat eyes perhaps laser surgery stave blindnessthe system performs par trained ophthalmologists according study published journal american medical association far completely replacing doctorearlier day pambaiyan balusamy  sat room google system diagnosed “proliferative” retinopathy left eye — serious form condition — could read scan right eye likely eye developed cataractdoctors sometimes make diagnosis faced cataracts blurry eye scans google system still struggles this trained largely clear unobstructed images retina though google exploring use lowerquality imageseven limitation dr kim said system augment doctors own aravind already operates small vision centers many cities villages surrounding madurai hope google system make eye screening easier facilities perhaps locations across southern indiatoday vision centers technicians take eye scans send doctors madurai review automated diagnosis streamline expand process reaching people places — kind “mcdonaldization” espoused dr vthe technology still faces regulatory hurdles india part difficulty navigating country’s bureaucracy though google’s eye system certified use europe still awaiting approval united statesluke oakdenrayner director medical imaging research royal adelaide hospital australia said systems might even need new regulatory frameworks existing rules weren’t always sufficient“i convinced people care enough safety systems” saidthough deeplearning systems new hardly first effort aid diagnosis computer technology dr oakdenrayner pointed out software called breast cad — approved food drug administration — widely adopted united states help detection breast cancer part medicaid provides rebate technology used studies shown patient outcomes improve cases declined“on paper google system performs well” dr oakdenrayner said “but roll huge population problems show years”
