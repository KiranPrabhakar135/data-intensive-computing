napalm cautionary tale tech giants pursuing military contractsover past months fierce debate erupted silicon valley whether large technology companies like amazon google microsoft join forces united states military along agencies like immigration customs enforcementthe debate largely conducted along ethical lineson one side tech executives many government officials argue time advanced technologies like artificial intelligence machine learning poised reshape top issues like drone warfare border security american tech giants patriotic duty pitch injeff bezos amazon’s chief executive summed view last year “if big tech companies going turn back us department defense country going trouble”on side groups employees companies including many antitrump progressives don’t want tools used drone warfare immigrant detention projects consider immoral side took stand microsoft last month group employees wrote open letter company’s top executives demanding abandon army contract would adapt hololens company’s augmentedreality headsets use soldiers battlefield“we sign develop weapons demand say work used” microsoft employees wrotethis debate worth having pragmatic question swirling around it one surprisingly people asking namely could big tech’s decision pursue controversial defense law enforcement contracts financial mistakeas business deals contracts seem like nobrainers microsoft’s hololens deal worth  million — less percent company’s revenue meaningful sum nonetheless amazon ibm microsoft oracle battling defense department cloudcomputing contract known project jedi worth much  billion winning bidderbut contracts may less lucrative appear and fact could come enormous hidden costs form damaged reputations recruiting problems customer boycotts could swamp shortterm gainsto explain why let’s consider one notorious military contracts past centuryin  dow chemical michiganbased chemicals manufacturer awarded  million department defense contract produce napalm highly incendiary chemical used american troops vietnam warhosted michael barbaro produced rachel quester clare toeniskoetter edited lisa tobinshould big tech partner pentagon examine cautionary talefrom new york times i’m michael barbaro “the daily” today across silicon valley tech companies pursuing contracts us military kevin roose cautionary tale lead it’s wednesday march so i’m tech columnist spend lot time talking looking big tech companies they’re going one interesting threads that’s come past year question silicon valley engage government military specifically think we’re point right government saying want things you’re building want part modernization effortsand within companies there’s growing divide management companies want business people actually building technology — engineers working advanced systems hot demand military government agencies saw play pretty meaningful way microsoftwhat happened there exactly last year microsoft signed contract department defense use technology called hololens armygood morning everyone years ago started asking ourselves could make things simple technology would disappearand hololens originally developed — it’s kind like headset augmented realitycould place digital content right world right life reality ever beforei saw demo couple years ago touting next generation gamingwelcome new era windows welcome windows holographicpeople wearing hololens would swinging imaginary sword imaginary monsters looked like happening right living roomand last year microsoft signed contract develop hololens technology use battlefield — give soldiers ability wear headsets get information surroundings increase lethality soldiers battlefieldso technology specifically deployed within military american soldiers better killing enemythat’s way it’s described contract yesand so i’m guessing something microsoft engineers objected toand there’s microsoft they’re receiving backlash employees new groundbreaking technologywell did pretty vocallyyeah microsoft employees signed letter demanding company cancel  million contract build hololens pentagon saying they quote —“dear satya nadella brad smith global coalition microsoft workers refuse create technology warfare oppression” goes on basically argue crossed line weapons development — basically taking something built turned something designed help soldiers battlefield kill soldiersright intent told going working on something comfortable withand kevin thinking this it’s hard imagine us military would use us technology americanmade technology like this warfare seems inevitable doesn’t itwell right mean long us tech industry there’s partnership us government military mean original internet came defense department projectand since then lots advances technology spurred collaboration pentagon silicon valley lot companies already provide technology military mean lot military computers run windows’s operating system bridge far employees say we’re ok basically providing generaluse technology stuff could go buy specific development technology use specific case crosses line us don’t want part itso kevin what’s interesting storywell i’m interested ethical debate around use artificial intelligence technologies i’m also business reporter think decision made along ethical lines companies also thinking businesses amount money profitability developing systems military wanted look along lines well let’s bracket ethical discussion second say make financial sensewell bracket it right isn’t company often going make decisions moral dilemmas based implications financesexactly philanthropies think tanks forprofit corporations generally operate costbenefit calculation plane wanted see make sense them music so little bit digging went back years history found example company sold something military later came regret itit’s case dow chemical  dow chemical small littleknown chemicals company based michigan make lots different things — household chemicals agricultural chemicalsnow favorite grocery store amazing food wrap ever developedthey probably best known making saran wraphave tried saran wrap really amazing look saran wrap clings like magicsaran wrap product dow chemical companyjet planes explosions vietnam united states helicopter gunships backed ground forces strong assault viet cong position —meanwhile vietnam war happening  dow chemical wins contract department defense produce new chemical called napalm b napalm highly flammable gel binds sticks things burns — use napalm b new formulation military excited using vietnamtroops followed advantage gained air support knock vcthey thought lot promise battlefield hard contain hard put out effective form weaponry — horrible form weaponry produced very bad burns people would basically burned alive so there’s much noise first little while americans start seeing images vietnam war lot people first time seeing effects napalmmost famously there’s photograph — you’ve probably seen it pulitzer prize photograph yearold girl who’s badly burned napalm weaponso far may killed million them mostly childrenand sort shocks american public galvanizes antiwar movementwhat think test latest weapons them germans tested new medicine new tortures concentration camps europecrowds chanting napalm napalm napalm napalmand decide go use napalm us armed forces way going dow chemicalthis monday afternoon november  san jose state college campus you’re watching result demonstration began hour agothey staged demonstrations outside company’s headquarters go dozens colleges dow recruiting students come work themthe professors war students democratic society marched front administration building protest recruitment campus dow chemical company employeesand protest recruiting sessions signs like “dow deforms children” “dow deals death”they’re allowing anyone in like people they’re allowing people connected dow protesters shoutingmy favorite story period dow recruiters — people would go campus talk students — would get locked classrooms would get like held hostage activists one point one recruiters got used started bringing sandwich briefcase inevitable happened got locked room bunch angry protesters —so sounds like complete corporate nightmare — company associated war death household product make — saran wrapright dow particularly offended napalm small part business mean accounted think half percent annual sales yet sort come take corporate identity internal discussion debates within company board level do whether stop manufacturing napalm lots reasons that mean customer boycotts take financial hit lot counter corporate reputation warmonger really worried recruiting worried visits college campuses weren’t going get best people weren’t going get scientists engineers would help years ahead result would longterm costs financial also terms missing onthe future employee moral objections napalm doesn’t come work dow chemical make next blockbuster productright ultimately decided stand ground said duty produce napalm us government it’s patriotic obligation withstand controversydow chemical feels like extreme case feels quite different what’s going tech companies todayyeah absolutely totally comparable mean vietnam war point extremely unpopular horrific images coming back there’s good use napalm right there’s prosocial healthy use napalm it’s weapon whereas lot technologies — ai facial recognition image recognition augmented reality — used productive healthy things it’s put certain context used harmand would seem case tech companies right developing products explicitly military happen used wayartificial intelligence drones warfare google — it’s mixture caused uproar inside tech giant early motto “don’t evil”there big controversy google last year military contract known project mavengoogle developing artificial intelligence analyze drone video dataand defense department program basically used ai imagerecognition technology interpret video imagesso kind ai google would use google photos selfdriving car unit recognize images road —it would apparently used part drone program— could used to example improve targeting drone strikes make drone strikes accurate able recognize certain people certain buildings able direct drone target specificallyagain google engineers probably ever thought technology would used forexactly mean didn’t sign that didn’t even know happeningthousands google workers protesting google’s involvement pentagon drone programso big uproar lots heated internal meetingsmeantime thousands google employees signed letter protesting company’s participation artificial intelligence project pentagonthere petition signed thousands google employeesquote “we believe google business war therefore asked project maven canceled”calling company enter contract stop making tools weaponry altogether ultimately —tech giant google end project pentagongoogle bowed pressure pulled contract said wouldn’t renew it put statement saying we’ll still work military projects we’re going manufacture weapons weaponsrelated technology seemed quiet unrest musici feel like people would surprised huge tech company like google would back like thatyeah mean speak difference conventional contractor like dow chemical tech companies think three main differences there first companies beloved loyal followings don’t want anything upset that second companies idealistic silicon valley big deal companies market profitable enterprises humanitarian projects anything compromises hurts themtotally think biggest difference employees companies — especially engineers work specialized projects like ai development — ton leverage many them make ton money they’re really hard recruit couple chemical engineers walk dow chemical protest probably find came from hundreds thousands ai engineers upset project google working on that’s real threat business doesn’t take many people staging protest threatening walk really get attention senior leadershipso three differences laid explain dow didn’t back down despite images dying children affected products whereas google back down long long anything like happened itright want clear happened google exception rule happening vast quantity across tech industry microsoft example came right said appreciate objections small group employees move elsewhere company want we’re committed seeing contract through they’ve defended saying patriotic duty provide technology military think advocate ethical use technologies like ai we’re table discussions say basically technologies could good could save lives battlefield army said wants use hololens combat training things like measuring vital signs monitoring soldiers concussions sort hearing protection people’s ears kinds arguments they’re making justify staying contractsso argument engineers came companies good technology used military necessarily mean goodyeah mean that’s one arguments they’re making that basically us military doesn’t best technology available market adversaries will endangered resulti guess question is engineers buy argumentwell probably do we’ve seen number don’t musicso kevin started talking intersection moral financial tech companies navigate question of work military what’s understanding silicon valley companies thinking thatso think lot companies really shifted view last couple years lot silicon valley companies used think toolmakers right build stuff put world people use it responsibility basically stops moment saleto me entrepreneurship creating change creating companiesand now think we’re seeing companies held responsible public employees tools they’re building they’re used world militaryat hour programmers threatening leave microsoft unless tech giant drops contract us immigration customs enforcement agency known icei mean also companies scrutinized working ice working law enforcementan amazon worker pushing company stop selling facial recognition technology law enforcementsocial media companies held responsible bad things happen platformsfacebook defending alex jones morning saying platform continue allow video blogger run video site even claims crack fake newsthis really happening across technology technology embeds every part lives we’re seeing companies make new kinds decisions it’s dollarsandcents profitandloss calculation anymore also consider might happen world release technologieswhich another way saying morality element playing much bigger role past perhaps beating financial rivaling itit’s certainly part discussion way hasn’t before it’s much money we’ll make many resources take it’s we’re building we’re building it we’re selling to musicdow known defense contractor — fact pentagon contract business best known making industrial chemicals household plastics like saran wrapbut next years americans began seeing gruesome
