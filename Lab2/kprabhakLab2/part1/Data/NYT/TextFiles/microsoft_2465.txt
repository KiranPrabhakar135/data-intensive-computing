dna gets new — bigger — genetic alphabetdna spelled four letters bases researchers built system eight may hold clues potential life elsewhere universe could also expand capacity store digital data earthin  chemist steven a benner sat colleagues notebook sketched way expand alphabet dna trying make sketches real ever sinceon thursday dr benner team scientists reported success paper published science said effect doubled genetic alphabet natural dna spelled four different letters known bases — a c g t dr benner colleagues built dna eight bases — four natural four unnatural named new system hachimoji dna hachi japanese eight moji lettercrafting four new bases exist nature chemical tourdeforce fit neatly dna’s double helix enzymes read easily natural bases order make molecules“we everything necessary life” said dr benner distinguished fellow foundation applied molecular evolution floridahachimoji dna could many applications including far durable way store digital data could last centuries “this could huge way” said dr nicholas v hud biochemist georgia institute technology involved researchit also raises profound question nature life elsewhere universe offering possibility fourbase dna familiar may chemistry could support life like science times page facebook  sign science times newsletterthe four natural bases dna anchored molecular backbones pair backbones join double helix bases attracted other bases form bond hydrogen atomsbut bases don’t stick together random c bond g bond t strict rules help ensure dna strands don’t clump together jumble matter sequence bases contained natural dna still keeps shapebut four bases compounds attach dna’s backbone link another base — least paper dr benner colleagues thought dozen alternativesworking swiss university eth zurich time dr benner tried make imaginary bases real“of course first thing discover design theory terribly good” said dr benneronce dr benner colleagues combined real atoms according designs artificial bases didn’t work hoped nevertheless dr benner’s initial forays impressed chemists “his work real inspiration me” said floyd e romesberg scripps research institute san diego reading dr benner’s early experiments dr romesberg decided try create basesdr romesberg chose make bases linked together hydrogen bonds instead fashioned pair oily compounds repelled water chemistry brought unnatural pair bases together “oil doesn’t like mix water like mix oil” said dr romesbergin years followed dr romesberg colleagues fashioned enzymes could copy dna made natural bases unnatural oily ones  scientists engineered bacteria could make new copies hybrid genes recent years dr romesberg’s team begun making unnatural proteins unnatural genes founded company synthorx develop proteins cancer drugsat time dr benner continued experiments colleagues succeeded creating one pair new baseslike dr romesberg found application unnatural dna sixbase dna became basis new sensitive test viruses blood samples went create second pair new bases eight bases play with researchers started building dna molecules variety different sequences researchers found matter sequence created molecules still formed standard double helixbecause hachimoji dna held onto shape could act like regular dna could store information information could read make moleculefor cell first step making molecule read gene using special enzymes make copy gene singlestranded version dna called rnadepending gene cell one two things rna cases use rna guide build protein cases rna molecule floats job owndr benner colleagues created hachimoji gene rna molecule predicted rna molecule would able grab molecule called fluorophore cradled rna molecule fluorophore would absorb light release green flashandrew ellington evolutionary engineer university texas led effort find enzyme could read hachimoji dna colleagues found promising one made virus tinkered enzyme could easily read eight basesthey mixed enzyme test tubes hachimoji gene hoped test tubes began glowing green“here start finish” said dr benner “we store information transfer another molecule molecule function — is glowing”in future hachimoji dna may store information radically different sort might someday encode movie spreadsheettoday movies spreadsheets digital files typically stored silicon chips magnetic tapes kinds storage serious shortcomings one thing deteriorate yearsdna contrast remain intact centuries last year researchers microsoft university washington managed encode songs videos documents files totaling megabytes batch dna molecules eight bases instead four hachimoji dna could potentially encode far information “dna capable twice much storage that’s pretty amazing view” said dr ellingtonbeyond current need storage hachimoji dna also offers clues life itself scientists long wondered dna evolved four bases they’re ones work genes could life taken different path“steve’s work goes long way say could — didn’t” said dr romesbergcarl zimmer writes “matter” column author thirteen books including “she mothers laugh powers perversions potential heredity” carlzimmer • facebook
