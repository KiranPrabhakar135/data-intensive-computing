there’s real core antimuslim violence here islamophobia farright ideology that’s very important focus there think there’s piece really need start grappling society there’s entire generation people exposed radical extremist politics online fed steady diet stuff it’s transformed tools internet provides i’ve talked lot white nationalists unfortunately asked got this lot say found couple videos youtube found videos youtube kind started opening eyes ideology pretty soon you’re white nationalist that’s different from historically extremism born mean —you know go library take book world war ii right you’re finish it librarian doesn’t say here here’s copy “mein kampf” might like this there’s kind algorithmic nudge toward extremes really exists social media demonstrated effect peoplewalk algorithmic nudge want make sure understand you’re referring tothis pretty specific youtube that’s lot stuff happens youtube there’s recommendations bar video plays another one follows it historically way algorithm chose video came next worked would try keep site long possible try maximize number videos watch amount time spent would maximize ad revenue right would maximize lots things turned kept people site longer longer periods time gradually moving toward extreme content start video spaceships you’d end something questioning whether moon landing hoax you’d start video piece us history and know five videos later you’re kind  conspiracy theory video kind gradual tugs toward stuff algorithm decides going keep hooked lot cases means making little extremeand what’s white nationalist version nudgethere’s ton white nationalism youtube youtube conversations i’ve people movement sort central ideas spread like start watching videos politics maybe they’re trump start watching videos sort fringey kind farright characters sudden watching someone’s video espousing open white nationalism you’re exactly sure got there keep watching percentage people internalize thatso it’s kind computerdriven onramp onboardingyeah studied like welldocumented phenomenon youtube done things try fix algorithm make it’s sending rabbit holes it’s still pretty observable effectand what’s understanding platforms didn’t act years ago police delete hatefilled videos content algorithmic nudges described directs people towards extremismthey reason to mean making lot money saw responsibility providing platform free speech hesitant kind seem like censoring certain political views committed free speech think that’s kind original sin that’s baked this it’s like part born idea provide platform people signal us like something we’ll show it maybe we’ll show something pushes envelope little bit more we’re optimizing truth we’re optimizing things think healthy people we’re giving want they’re trying change now them there’s reckoning platforms come understand role they’ve played they’re trying correct it there’s lot people already sucked world radicalized may coming back it’s going very tricky slow thing set motion don’t even know it’s possibleyeah platforms played pivotal role played playing pivotal role extremist groups gather momentum share ideas coalesce real movements grow and like that’s part don’t think they’ve completely reckoned with don’t think we’ve completely reckoned with think we’re still sort coming terms fact there’s pipeline extremism know runs know happens know who’s involved know sometimes devastating tragic consequences i’ve thinking inevitable feelsi’ve watching people kind dark corners internet multiplying hardening becoming extreme and like inevitable nightmare right worst possible version something could happen broadcast internet it’s getting better it’s going us long timebut also strikes way pretty awful way gunman way approached massacre kind reflecting back internet functions i’m thinking making video attack which sense means he’s making content feeds loop we’re discussing perhaps feeds algorithm possibly fed — he’s basically putting something back systemyeah saw happening platforms like real time —yeah went onto chan website stuff posted comments post about let’s save videos reupload somewhere else —— case
